<p>Leave of Absence (LOA)</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin our school after they return
from overseas. If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered
student of the school. They can then be readmitted to the school directly
after returning to Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all the following criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An SC or PR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presently studying in an MOE school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accompanying you on an overseas posting with the intention of rejoining
their school after returning to Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>School will charge a nominal fee for a child on LOA. Upon successful application,
the school will advise on the payment procedure for the LOA fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may wish to know that the LOA is renewable annually. By November each
year, you will need to decide whether to renew the LOA for another year.
Your child’s LOA status will expire if you choose not to renew.</p>

<br>As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, the Ministry
of Education had announced that all students in Singapore schools will
be supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space
(SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources
and learning tools.</p>
<p>With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of
technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their
own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also
be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further
enriching students’ learning experience. We believe such a learning experience
is essential to help your child to become an active and confident user
of technology.</p>
