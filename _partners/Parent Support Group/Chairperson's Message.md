### Chairperson’s Message

Dear Parents,

The PSG would like to extend our warmest welcome to you and your child on an enriching 6-year educational journey with Peiying Primary School.

The PSG not only plays an integral role in ensuring each child achieves their potential through our involvement in school activities; we also believe that the close collaboration between parents and the school forges a deeper level of trust between parents and educators and a closer relationship between us and our children.

On behalf of the PSG Exco, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for the constant support of parents to make our children’s schooling journey a fulfilling and memorable experience.

If you would like to be part of this PSG family and play a more significant role in your child’s educational journey, please join us!

Warmest Regards,<br>
Jeffrey Koo<br>
Chairperson for PSG Exco 


### Vice Chairperson’s Message
Dear Parents,<br>
As an ex-student of Peiying Primary School, I am pleased to be back in school and contribute to the PSG. <br><br>
I first joined the PSG to be part of my daughter’s educational journey in primary school. With my involvement in PSG, I now realise that I can make a difference not just to my daughter but also to other students in the school. <br><br>
The PSG embraces the school’s core values, vision and mission and works in partnership with the school leaders and teachers to support the school’s endeavours and the development of our children. When we first started, only about 10 parents were active. Now, we are glad to see that the number has grown. <br><br>
We look forward to welcoming you to our PSG family. Together, let us be part of the schooling experience of our children and cherish the moments we have with them before they graduate from primary school. 

Warmest Regards,<br>
Suzzana<br>
Vice Chairperson for PSG Exco
