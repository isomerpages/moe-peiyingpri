### **Student Vision Outcomes**
At Peiying Primary School, we look for the strengths in our students and we strive to help our students realise their full potential. Each child is respected as an individual and nurtured to grow and develop. Our students learn to give their best in all that they do, to persevere and to ‘never give up’. The school focuses on character building and on the inculcation of values such as honesty and development of respect and care for the people around them.
