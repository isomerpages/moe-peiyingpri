<p>Peiying Primary School, formerly known as Poi Eng Public School, is one
of the oldest schools in Nee Soon.</p>
<p>The history of Peiying can be traced back to 1919 when the famous philanthropist,
Lim Nee Soon, set up Fa Chu School at Jalan Ulu Seletar. Fa Chu School
was later moved to Kangkar and renamed Zang Hua School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January, 1941, the school merged with Qi Zhi School to form Poi Eng
Public School which was then located at Upper Thomson Road (next to the
former Seletar Institute).&nbsp; Poi Eng Public School was supported by
the local community and provided education to the Chinese children in Nee
Soon.</p>

<p>In 1987, Poi Eng Public School was relocated to Yishun Ring Road, became
a Government school and renamed as Peiying Primary School. In Chinese,
‘Poi Eng’ or ‘Pei Ying’ means ‘to nurture citizens for nation building’.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>While waiting for the completion of the new school building in Yishun
Ring Road, Peiying held classes at Chongfu Primary School for nine months.
In 1988, the new $4.69 million school building was completed. It was equipped
with 36 classrooms, music room, art &amp; craft room, language rooms, extra-curricular
rooms, computer room and a dental clinic. The 2-in-1 canteen cum hall building
had a lantern-like squarish roof-top that allowed natural light into the
school hall. The compound also housed two outdoor basketball courts, a
car park which doubled up as the assembly area and a school field shared
with the neighbouring secondary school. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1998, an Adventure Tower was installed in the school compound and accentuated
the emphasis on Outdoor Adventure as part of the holistic education that
Peiying delivers. From 2001 to 2003, Peiying Primary School went through
the PRIME upgrading and a new block of classrooms was added. 2018 marked
the completion of an Indoor Sports Hall through the PERI Upgrading project.</p>
