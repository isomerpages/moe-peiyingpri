### **Principal's Message 2022**
Peiying Primary school has a long history in the Yishun estate. It was formerly known as Poi Eng Public School and is one of the oldest schools in Nee Soon. Its roots can be traced back to 1919. In Chinese, ‘Pei Ying’ means ‘to nurture citizens for nation building’. 

Peiying Primary has the hallmark of a fine school. It is steeped in traditions and values. At the same time, we are also agile, adaptable and forward thinking to keep in pace with the educational developments that are happening around us. Education in Peiying Primary School prepares students not just for the present. We strive to equip students with knowledge and skills so that they are future-ready.

In Peiying Primary School, we design lessons and programmes for students to be curious, ask questions and be inquisitive. We hope to work with parents and the community to nurture students to take charge of their learning, be motivated to learn and take responsibility in the things they do. We believe that learning is about discovery, asking questions and having an openness towards new things. As learners, students must have the time and space to discover their interests and passions. 

The school community has an unwavering belief in working closely with stakeholders in innovating the teaching process. All the staff in Peiying Primary School strongly believe in **Building Character, Enriching Lives and Stretching Potential**. We value and embrace every child who enters our school and we put in our best efforts to nurture them to become **Engaged and Resilient learners, Caring Citizens and Leaders of Character**. We encourage our students to find their passion and to dream. We hope to inspire our students to stretch themselves accordingly in all that they do so that they can realise their own potential and discover their own motivation to try to surpass themselves every day.

In Peiying Primary School, we enable all children to grow in wisdom, develop courage to face whatever uncertainties that may come their way, and in turn, use their gifts for the good of our school and the community.

Mrs Peh-Wong Wei Yong

Principal, Peiying Primary School
