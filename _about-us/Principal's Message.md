## Principal's Message 2025


Established in 1919, Peiying Primary School stands as a beacon of educational heritage in the Yishun estate. Our name, 'Pei Ying', embodies our century-long mission of nurturing citizens for nation building. As we honour our rich history, we also lead the way in innovative education, through our distinctive programmes and robust character development initiatives.

At the heart of our forward-thinking approach lies our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), "Project T.H.I.N.K. (Thinking Holistic Innovative Networked Kids) for Home Earth." This programme sets Peiying apart, cultivating in our students a deep-rooted love for the environment and equipping them with Design Thinking skills. Through Project T.H.I.N.K., our students actively contribute to making Singapore a greener, more sustainable city, bridging classroom learning with real-world impact.

Complementing our ALP is our unique Learning for Life Programme (LLP), "Sports, Character Development, Adventure Learning Experiences (SCALE) @ Peiying". SCALE develops our students' sense of adventure and ruggedness through outdoor exploration, while also promoting a lifelong appreciation for sports and healthy living. Our SCALE programme challenges students physically and mentally, building resilience and teamwork skills.

Character development is a cornerstone of the Peiying experience. Our comprehensive Citizenship and Character Education (CCE) programme is designed to nurture students into Leaders of Character. Guided by our PRIDE values - Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence, and Empathy - we create numerous opportunities for character growth. Character and Citizenship Education lessons allow students to discuss and understand important values and social issues.

Values in Action (VIA) projects allow students to apply their values in real-world contexts, fostering empathy and social responsibility. Student Leadership development programmes empower students to take on roles of responsibility, cultivating confidence and decision-making skills. Reflection sessions encourage students to think critically about their actions and experiences, promoting self-awareness and personal growth. Character-building initiatives such as Growth Mindset lessons work in tandem with our strong academic curriculum, ensuring that Peiying students develop into well-rounded individuals prepared for life's challenges.

At Peiying Primary School, we are committed to fostering a joyful learning environment. Our approach encompasses a myriad of hands-on activities, technology-enhanced education, and creative expression across different subjects. We extend learning beyond classroom walls through learning journeys and community partnerships, while empowering students to lead initiatives. Our educators employ differentiated learning strategies and positive reinforcement to ensure each child experiences success. Through collaborative projects and peer-to-peer learning opportunities, we cultivate a vibrant educational atmosphere. This multifaceted approach instils a lifelong passion for knowledge acquisition, aligning with our vision of nurturing lifelong learners prepared for future challenges.

Peiying Primary School stands as a beacon of educational excellence, where a century of wisdom meets contemporary innovation. Our staff, united in their commitment to nurturing young minds, embrace this rich legacy whilst driving progress. We believe in nurturing every child's potential. Our dedicated educators and admin staff provide attention, inspiring students to stretch beyond their perceived limits and discover their unique strengths. We work closely with parents and partners to create an environment where curiosity thrives, critical thinking is honed, and a love for learning is instilled for life.
As we look to the future, we remain steadfast in our mission: to provide each student with a robust foundation for success, honouring our heritage whilst preparing them for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow.
