## Principal's Message


Peiying Primary School has a long history in the Yishun estate. It was formerly known as Poi Eng Public School and is one of the oldest schools in Nee Soon. Its roots can be traced back to 1919. In Chinese, “Pei Ying’ means ‘to nurture citizens for nation building”. The school is steeped in traditions and values. In 2022, the school embarked on a re-envisioning exercise. The new vision “**_Lifelong Learners, Leaders of Character_**” will guide our planning and decision-making process in the next few years.

#### _Lifelong Learners_

As a school, we aspire to meaningfully pique our students' interest in their learning and encourage them to be lifelong learners. It is important to guide our students to discover, distill and discern information. Our key task is thus to help our students sense-make, be self-directed and to start from young. We create opportunities for our students to collaborate, connect and create. This is achievable through our school programmes. One of them is our Applied Learning Programme “Project T.H.I.N.K. (Thinking Holistic Innovative Networked Kids) for Home Earth.” This programme helps to instill within our students a love for the environment that we are all living in and guides students in creating a real and positive impact towards making Singapore a greener and more sustainable city through Design Thinking.

#### _Leaders of Character_

We focus on character-building and leadership development of our students and are guided by our school values: PRIDE which stands for Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence and Empathy. Through our Citizenship and Character Programmes and Student Development Programmes, we enable and encourage our students to grow in wisdom, be open and develop courage to face whatever uncertainties that may come their way. We hope that in turn, they will use their gifts for the greater good of our school, the community and the nation.

Through our Learning for Life Programme “Sports, Character Development, Adventure Learning Experiences (SCALE) @ Peiying”, we develop in our students a sense of adventure and ruggedness through exploration of the outdoor environment. Students also learn different types of sports to hone their psychomotor skills and acquire a mindset of enjoying sports for healthy living.

The human touch of teachers to nurture, guide, and inspire, is at the heart of teaching in our school. Staff in Peiying Primary School focus on higher value-added work with the students, inspire learners from all backgrounds, and stoke the curiosity of our students to learn not just for exams, and not just for their time in school, but to learn throughout life.

We inspire our students to stretch themselves accordingly in all that they do so that they can realise their own potential, be resilient and discover their own motivation to try to surpass themselves every day. We strongly believe in Building Character, Enriching Lives and Stretching Potential of our students. We value and embrace every child who enters our school and we put in our best efforts to nurture them to become Engaged and Resilient learners, Caring Citizens and Leaders of Character.
