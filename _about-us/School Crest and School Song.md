The school crest embodies the school's aims and aspirations.  

The ‘P' signifies progress and prosperity.<br>
The ‘Y' signifies righteousness, steadfastness and strength.<br>

The colour red symbolises brotherhood. The colour white symbolises purity.<br>
Together, they represent mutual understanding and respect for one another.   

The background colours of blue and white signify harmony and working towards a bright and better future.
