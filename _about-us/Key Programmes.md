### **Key Programmes**

##### **Student-centric values-driven holistic education**
At Peiying Primary School, the underpinning philosophy of teaching and learning is the belief that every child can learn, improve and fulfil his potential to become contributing citizens. The school seeks to stretch the potential of its students, build character and enrich lives. With the student at the centre of the curriculum, the school adopts various pedagogies to engage and motivate as we deliver content knowledge and skills with the infusion of core values in a safe and nurturing environment. The key programmes in the school are specially planned and designed to stretch the potential in each and every child to make learning at Peiying fun and  meaningful.

#### **Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Project THINK (Thinking Holistic Innovative Networked Kids) for Home Earth since 2019**
Project THINK for Home Earth is focused on environment education and is designed to enable P1 to P6 students to be ‘future-ready’. This is done by enabling them to be environmentally literate individuals who can understand environmental issues and how human decisions affect environmental quality. Through this programme, students will learn how to use the knowledge they have about the environment to problem-solve and derive innovative solutions.
