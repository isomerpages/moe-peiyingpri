##### **Culture of Care**
**Peiying Primary School** is a caring school. As part of our Culture of Care, we look for the strengths in our students and we strive to help our students realise their full potential. Peiying places emphasis on character building and inculcation of values. Our caring culture ensures that each child is respected as an individual and nurtured to grow and develop into future ready citizens. Our students learn to give their best in all that they do, to persevere and to ‘never give up’. They are able to face the challenges of a complex and changing world with ‘Wisdom and Courage.’ Peiying prepares our students to have the wisdom to make good choices in their lives and the courage to do the right thing.
