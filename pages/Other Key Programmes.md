Students start learning the fundamentals of computational thinking at Primary 3, 4 and the programme is continued at Primary 6. This programme offers a fun and interactive way for students to learn programming skills. In addition, it enhances logical thinking, analytical skills and how students organise data. The skills learnt are subsequently applied in the Project Work of the students.

In Peiying, Project Work is an integrated learning experience which aims to provide students with the opportunity to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning, and critically and creatively apply it to real life situations. This process, which enhances students’ knowledge and enables them to  acquire 21st Century competencies like collaboration, communication and independent learning, prepares them for lifelong learning and the challenges ahead in this fast-changing environment. All students from Primary 1 onwards participate in Project Work.

Opportunities are provided for students to develop skills needed to  become active contributors, confident persons, self-directed learners and concerned citizens through their participation in experiential learning such as the growing of vegetable using hydroponics and aeroponics. The vegetables grown are distributed to needy families in the neighbourhood and add a ‘values-in-action’ dimension to the programme.
