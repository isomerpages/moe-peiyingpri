##### **ENGAGED LEARNERS**
Learning is fun at Peiying and students experience joy of learning in the school.  Our programmes are broad-based, holistic and engaging. Learning is exciting and is enhanced by a wide range of experiences such as outdoor education, exposure to art and music, coding programmes and field trips.

##### **RESILIENT LEARNERS**
Students at Peiying enjoy many activities to help them learn how to be resilient and ‘never give up’. SCALE@Peiying, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), is a 6-year sports and outdoor adventure education programme which helps our students develop resilience through intellectual and physical challenges.

##### **LEADERS OF CHARACTER**
At Peiying, we believe that every child can be a leader. Our structured leadership programme ensures that every child is given the guidance and opportunity to hone his or her leadership skills and to apply them in various roles.

##### **CARING CITIZENS**
Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Project THINK for Home Earth, provides experiential activities for students to develop a strong sense of civic responsibility towards the environment and the community, thus helping them to grow into caring citizens.
