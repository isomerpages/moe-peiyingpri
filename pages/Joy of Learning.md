### **Joy of Learning**
Learning is fun at Peiying. Our programmes are broad-based, holistic and engaging. Learning is exciting and is enhanced by a wide range of experiences such as outdoor education, exposure to art and music, coding programmes and field trips.

We had created amazing memories which we would treasure. We learned how to work together as a team. We had learned the importance of encouraging our friends to make right decisions through ‘Conscience Alley’. The PAL Drama lessons had taught us how to express our feelings. We had chances to create our own freeze frames. The lessons had also helped us discover our love for drama.<br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;">-Edelyn, Yinuo, Zakyah, Evans, Joseph and Hong Hao (1 Courage, 2019)<br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"></td></tr></tbody></table>

We got to do things that we have never done before. We fed the frogs, ducks and fishes. We not only got to learn about the life cycle of a frog, but we also got to see and touch them at the various stages of their life cycle. It was a new experience for all of us. We had also learnt how to differentiate between a frog and a toad. The guides took the trouble to explain all the information to us in detail, so we showed them respect by giving them our full attention. It was indeed a fun-filled learning experience for all of us.</div><div style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;"><br style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"></div><div style="margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 22.4px; text-align: justify;">-Xiao Jie, Kenji, Hui Xin, Zach and Saanjhaay (4 Respect, 2019)</div></td></tr></tbody></table>
