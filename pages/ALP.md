Project THINK for Home Earth is focused on environment education and is designed to enable students to be ‘future-ready’. This is done by enabling them to be environmentally literate individuals who can understand environmental issues and how human decisions affect environmental quality. Through this programme, students will learn how to use the knowledge they have about the environment to problem-solve and derive innovative solutions.
