Dear Parents,

The Parents Support Group (PSG) would like to extend the warmest welcome to you and your child on an enriching 6-year educational journey with Peiying Primary School.

The PSG not only plays an integral role in ensuring each child achieves their maximum potential through our involvement in school activities, we believe that the close collaboration between parents and the school forges a deeper trust between parents and educators, as well as a closer relationship between parents and children.

On behalf of the PSG Executive Committee (PSG Exco), I would also like to express my deepest gratitude for the constant support of parents, to make everyone's educational journey, in academia and in life, regardless of age, a fulfilling and memorable experience.

If you would like to be part of this big PSG family and play a bigger part in your child's educational journey, please join us!

Warmest Regards,

Jeffrey Koo
Chairperson for PSG Exco
