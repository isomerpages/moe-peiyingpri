<p>At Peiying Primary School, we believe in nurturing leaders of character
and caring citizens. As part of our commitment to holistic education and
student well-being, we implemented a series of meaningful initiatives under
the Preventive Drug Education 2025 programme. This year’s focus was on
three important learning points: (i) Understanding the harmful effects
of drug misuse (ii) Building confidence to say “NO” to drugs (iii) Developing
healthy ways to manage negative emotions.</p>
<p>The programme began with pre-assembly and assembly sessions that equipped
students with knowledge about the dangers of drugs and the importance of
making wise decisions. These were followed by interactive classroom activities
and recess campaigns, which encouraged peer discussions and reinforced
key takeaways in a fun and memorable way. Students also had the opportunity
to express their learning through creative poster design, sharing preventive
drug education messages. A meaningful ribbon-folding activity during recess
also allowed students to pledge their commitment to staying drug-free.</p>
<p>The campaign concluded with a school-wide showcase of student posters,
celebrating their voices and ideas. To strengthen home-school partnership,
a message was shared with parents via Parent Gateway, helping to extend
the conversation at home.</p>

with the knowledge, skills, and values to thrive and to make safe, positive
choices for their future.</p>

performances.</p>
<p>This year, students attended a Chinese drama performance titled <em>“Journey to the West – Thrice Borrowing the Plantain Fan” 《三借芭蕉扇》</em>,
staged by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Cultural Academy. The performance,
adapted from one of the classic episodes of the renowned Chinese literary
work <em>Journey to the West</em>, offered students a unique opportunity
to experience the richness of traditional Chinese storytelling and stagecraft.</p>
<p>Through this exposure, students deepened their appreciation for the Chinese
language and culture. By witnessing the expressive use of language, characterisation,

<p>On 9 August 2025, Singapore celebrated our 60th National Day. This year’s
theme, <em>“Majulah Singapura”</em> (Onward Singapore), echoed the title
of our national anthem and served as both a reflection of our nation’s
journey and a call to move forward together with unity and purpose.</p>
<p>At Peiying Primary School, we commemorated this significant occasion through
a series of engaging recess activities and a meaningful National Day Celebration.</p>
<p>The celebration began with a ceremonial segment that included the raising
of the national flag, the singing of the national anthem, and the recitation
of the national pledge. These symbolic acts instilled a strong sense of
identity and unity among our students, reminding them of their role as
active citizens and their shared responsibility in shaping Singapore’s
future.</p>

by our Performing Arts groups, a National Day presentation, videos, and
a photo montage. These showcased key moments in Singapore’s history - from
the challenges of separation to the successes of today - encouraging students
to appreciate the resilience of our pioneers and the importance of continuing
Singapore’s story with courage and determination.</p>
<p>Through these activities, our students were reminded of the value of nationhood,

<p>As part of our continued commitment to student well-being, Peiying Primary
School launched this year’s Anti-Bullying Programme with the theme <strong>“The Power of Kindness.”</strong> This
initiative aims to nurture a culture of care and respect, where students
build strong, positive peer relationships and develop a clear understanding
of what constitutes unacceptable behaviours.</p>
<p>The programme highlights the importance of making responsible choices
and treating others with kindness and empathy. A series of activities were
carried out to reinforce the message, including Pre-assembly talks on “The
Power of Kindness”, assembly programme and recess activities. At its core,
it encourages students to become Upstanders, to actively stand up against
unacceptable behaviours and support their peers. Thus, fostering a safe
school environment.</p>
<p>A key focus of the initiative is also to strengthen our peer support culture.
Through their involvement, our Peer Buddy Leaders were empowered to take
on greater responsibilities, demonstrating leadership and promoting awareness
across the school. One such effort was the Anti-Bullying Book Display in
the school library, curated to engage students meaningfully in conversations
about kindness, empathy, and respect.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, our students were reminded of their shared
responsibility in creating a caring school community. Together, we continue
to empower every child to act with kindness, empathy, and courage.</p>

embarked on an unforgettable adventure at the MOE Jalan Bahtera Outdoor
Adventure Learning Centre. Surrounded by nature, the 3-day camp offered
a meaningful opportunity for students to build friendships, develop resilience,
and create lasting memories.</p>
<p>Teamwork was at the heart of many activities, such as the Low Rope Elements,
where students learned the importance of communication, cooperation, and
supporting one another. Working towards shared goals helped them develop
empathy and a strong sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Students also took on exciting personal challenges, including the Rock-climbing
Wall and Challenge Rope Course. These high elements pushed them out of
their comfort zones, helping them overcome fears and grow in perseverance
and self-confidence. Activities like Abseiling and Zip-lining further strengthened
their courage and trust in their peers and safety equipment.</p>

sounds and styles of each instrument. From the soaring melodies of the
violin to the rich harmonies of the viola and the deep resonance of the
cello, the assembly opened our students’ ears to the beauty of string music.</p>
<p>More than just a performance, the assembly aimed to spark joy and inspire
a lasting love for music. By seeing and hearing these instruments up close,
we hope our students feel encouraged to explore their own musical interests.</p>
<p>This event reflects Peiying Primary School’s commitment to a well-rounded
education that nurtures creativity and passion in every child.</p>

<p>On 31 July 2025, our school had the pleasure of hosting Book Buzz, an
enriching programme by the National Library Board (NLB) that introduced
students to captivating reads by local authors. The session was designed
to spark curiosity and deepen students’ appreciation for reading.</p>
<p>Students were introduced to a variety of books, which include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>Hidden Creatures</em> by Mary-Ruth Low – a fascinating dive into the
secret lives of animals we rarely notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Out &amp; About in Singapore 2</em> by Melanie Lee – an adventurous
guide that uncovers fun and unique spots around our island.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sengkang Snoopers: The Secrets of the Tiger’s Den</em> by Peter Tan
– a thrilling mystery that kept students on the edge of their seats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through interactive book sharing and lively discussions, students explored
themes such as biodiversity, heritage, and creative storytelling. The session
not only broadened their perspectives but also reminded them that reading

<p>On July 24, 2025, our school commemorated Racial Harmony Day with the
theme "Our People, Our Tapestry", a celebration of Singapore’s multicultural
identity and the rich traditions that unite us as one nation. The highlight
of the celebration was a vibrant Assembly Programme, where students were
treated to an engaging presentation highlighting the importance of racial
harmony and our shared heritage. A colourful Fashion Parade followed, featuring
students and teachers proudly showcasing traditional ethnic attire - a
lively expression of the diversity that binds us together as a community.</p>
<p>The day was filled with meaningful activities that deepened students’
appreciation for cultural diversity. During recess, students explored various
traditions through hands-on cultural experiences supported by our dedicated
Parent Support Group (PSG). These included thoranam (Indian decorative
garlands), ketupat weaving (a traditional Malay craft), rangoli art, colouring
the wau (traditional Malay kite), and decorating Chinese dumpling forms.
Together with student reflections, contributions from the PSG and students
culminated in a stunning Harmony Garden visual display - a creative tribute
to the spirit of unity in diversity.</p>
<p>This year’s Racial Harmony Day commemoration was a powerful reminder that
while we come from diverse backgrounds, we are all threads of the same
tapestry — stronger and more beautiful together.</p>

Festival 2025, marking our third year of collaboration in this meaningful
community initiative. This event served as a valuable platform to showcase
the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Environmental Education
and to share our continued efforts in promoting sustainability with the
wider community.</p>
<p>Our ALP Ambassadors played an active role in engaging residents, raising
awareness about eco-friendly practices, and encouraging community support
for our sustainability initiatives. A key highlight of our booth was the
display of toys creatively made by students using upcycled materials, which
drew enthusiastic responses from children and adults alike. The interactive
nature of these exhibits allowed the community to experience the joy of
play while learning about the importance of reusing materials.</p>
<p>In addition, residents enhanced their knowledge of sustainability through
the Peiying signature Snakes and Ladders game. Another well-received feature
was the repurposing of cooler bags into practical tissue box holders. It
was an innovative idea that inspired many visitors.</p>

<p>Our Primary 5 students embarked on an enriching three-day learning journey
to Penang, Malaysia, immersing themselves in the vibrant tapestry of local
culture and heritage. Through visits to historical sites like the UNESCO-listed
George Town, the magnificent Blue Mansion, and the fascinating Peranakan
Museum, students gained profound insights into Penang's rich multicultural
heritage.</p>
<p>A highlight was their visit to Entopia Park, where many students had their
first thrilling encounter with diverse insects and small reptiles like
geckos in their natural habitats, fostering a deeper appreciation for wildlife
conservation and animal adaptations.</p>
<p>Demonstrating resilience and independence, they also participated in traditional
craft workshops, creating their own wayang kulit puppets and learning the
intricate art of bead-stringing to make star-shaped keychains, while discovering
the cultural significance of beadwork in Penang's history.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of their journey was the school immersion experience at PIBK
SJKC Perempuan China, where students displayed exemplary PRIDE values whilst
engaging with their Penang peers in activities ranging from handicraft
sessions to collaborative pizza-making. Their growth mindset was evident
as they embraced new experiences, overcame challenges, and forged meaningful
cross-cultural friendships.</p>
<p>These shared experiences not only broadened their global perspectives

<p>P.L.A.Y. Day on 15 April was a blast!</p>
<p>Our students had an exciting time learning beyond the classroom, where
each level explored unique programmes that build knowledge, skills, and
values.</p>
<p>As part of our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), our Primary 1 students
visited the Singapore Zoo. They get up close with wildlife whilst learning
about conservation and environmental awareness.</p>
<p>Primary 2 students explored Gardens by the Bay, guided by our very own
teachers! They learned how plants adapt to different conditions and the
importance of preserving nature. It was an eye-opening experience that
brought science to life in the real world.</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 to 6 students took part in two exciting programmes:</p>
<p>In the Growth Mindset Programme, students had a great time trying to solve
the Rubik’s Cube. With each twist and turn, they practised resilience and
reminded themselves that “Everyone can learn and they just haven’t learnt
it yet!” This hands-on challenge helped them embrace mistakes and grow
their problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Student Leadership Programme empowered our students to
become confident, empathetic, and effective leaders through team-based
activities and thoughtful reflection.</p>
<p>These experiences showed our students that learning happens everywhere
– from nature walks to puzzle-solving. Most importantly, they learned that
with the right mindset, growth is always possible.</p>

<p>International Friendship Day (IFD) was commemorated on 17 April 2025.
The theme for International Friendship Day (IFD) 2025 is “Forging Friendships
in A Complex World”. For this year’s IFD Commemoration, the Character and
Citizenship Education (CCE) department put together an assembly programme
and a series of activities for both CCE-FTGP lessons as well as recess
activities to emphasise the importance of our country's role in the region
and fostering strong bonds with our neighbours.</p>
<p>During our school assembly, students learnt about ASEAN countries, with
a special focus on Malaysia, the 2025 ASEAN Chair. Students learnt more
about the culture in Malaysia, language, food, and people. A specially
prepared video featuring our students from the ASEAN countries also helped
to connect us across borders. The assembly ended on a vibrant note with
a performance of a traditional Malaysian dance.</p>
<p>Recess activities were carried out to complement the learning from the
assembly programme. Students gained knowledge about the flags and currencies
of the ASEAN countries. Through answering quizzes, students were actively
engaged in showing their understanding of International Friendship Day.
They also wrote well wishes to their friends from ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>We hope that these learning experiences will reinforce the understanding
of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond.</p>

students together to learn about the rich traditions of Hari Raya visiting.
The event fostered cultural appreciation and a deeper understanding of
its customs and values.</p>

their non-Muslim peers to Hari Raya traditions. Students learned about:</p>
<p>✅ Wearing festive attire</p>
<p>✅ Greeting others with the traditional "Salaam"</p>
<p>✅ Dining etiquette, including eating with hands</p>
<p>✅ The tradition of giving green packets</p>
<p>✅ The joy of mass singing and dancing</p>
<p>An interactive Forum Theatre segment encouraged students to participate
in discussions on gratitude, empathy, respect, and togetherness— the core
values of Hari Raya.</p>
<p>The celebration was a resounding success, deepening cultural awareness
and strengthening bonds within our diverse school community. It was heartwarming
to see students embrace the spirit of unity and respect that Hari Raya
represents.</p>

<p>Peiying Primary School is thrilled to announce the launch of English Language
Fiesta 2025, themed "Occupations: From All Walks of Life." This year’s
event is designed to immerse our students in a language-enriched environment,
helping them develop as engaged learners and confident communicators, and
adopt healthy reading habits.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the event will be “A Date with Books” to cultivate
the joy for reading. Students also get to enjoy pre-assembly activities
in the hall, such as listening to stories read by our English Language
Ambassadors. Additionally, teachers engaged students through storytelling
sessions in their classrooms, while encouraging a love for reading. On
April 4, 2025, both students and teachers had the opportunity to showcase
their creativity by dressing up as individuals in various professions.
Through engaging activities and creative expression, we're helping our
students discover the diverse world of careers while building essential
language skills.</p>
<p>Level-specific activities were also designed to enhance the students'
language learning experience during the EL Fiesta, such as Choral Reading
by Primary 1 students, “Meet the illustrator” for our Primary 2 students
and SLS lesson packages for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students which encourage
them to learn about different careers and understand their roles in society.
Through this language experience, we hope to develop leaders of character
who actively participate in school events and appreciate the diversity
of occupations around them.</p>

<p>On 13 February 2025, our school commemorated Total Defence Day. 15 February
is a day etched in our hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation
during challenging times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during
World War II.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, students and staff experienced a water disruption
simulation. All the water points in the canteen and Staff Room were cordoned
off during the recess periods. Students and staff had to find other sources
of water in another location in the school. It was a tangible reminder
of our vulnerability, given Singapore's dependence on water supply and
the potential disruptions it could entail. This exercise also helped our
students develop the resilience and adaptability needed to cope with such
real-world challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights. It's not just about experiencing the
simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity and resilience within
our school community, echoing the spirit of Total Defence that has sustained
our nation.</p>

Cards. At the <strong>Friendship Card Booth</strong>, they wrote notes of
appreciation to their friends. Over in the library, students were encouraged
