### **PAL**
##### **Programme for Active Learning**
In Peiying Primary School, PAL creates opportunities for our Primary 1 and 2 students to apply their learning through the domains of Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts and Performing Arts. Guided by the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) 2021 Curriculum, every PAL lesson is designed to reinforce teaching and learning of values, develop social-emotional competencies and nurture citizenship dispositions.Â 

The five characteristics of PAL are as follows:<br>
1\. Focus on Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and values<br>
2\. Be driven by experiential learning<br>
3\. Encompass learning in creative ways<br>
4\. Provide opportunities to create<br>
5\. Engage in fun and enjoyable learning
