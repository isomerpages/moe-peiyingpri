### **Music (Primary 1)**
Students are given the opportunity to make music with different percussion. They learn how to express their thoughts and emotions through rhythms using various percussions such as Boomwhackers, Chime Bars and Handbells. Students show willingness to explore different ways of doing things and work in groups to be innovative in their ideas and performances.
