#### **Art Club**
Art Club is a platform where students’ creativity and imagination are allowed to take flight as well as developing their thinking skills. Students are exposed to different art forms such as 3-Dimensional mixed media techniques, acrylic painting and print making.

Our students’ artwork titled, “Daily Reflections” was awarded the Certificate of Recognition. This artwork was also selected and exhibited at SCAPE in conjunction with the Singapore Youth Festival 2017. At this event, the students had opportunities to present and share their artwork to other participants.

In the Library Council, the students play icebreaker games which help them understand their friends in the CCA better.

 Some examples of everyone’s favourites are Blow Wind Blow, Charades and 2 Truths 1 Lie! The students also play a variety of board games such as Scrabble which broadens their scope of vocabulary. For those who like to challenge their brains, there are word puzzles and brain teaser activities.

Drama is also a very exciting experience for those who want to be the star of the show. Through drama, students can overcome any stage fright they might have and improve their oral skills.
