their environment, using photography to tell stories and communicate ideas.
Members develop a deep understanding of using digital cameras and iPads,
delving into composition techniques, camera settings, and basic editing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The club also focuses on character growth, embracing the school’s core
values of Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence, and Empathy (PRIDE)
through photoshoots and discussions. Members document school events, gaining
confidence and sharpening their abilities through real-world experience.
By exploring diverse themes, mastering digital photography techniques,

<h4>Library Council</h4>

<iframe height="450" width="800" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSvXxWmg2krLy0CT0jo_GLn9GH1oR73S5Lx9nxgndQDzfYBlLWKmNDw4tjZIixNf__wsJq2tgob3jj2/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>
</div>
<p>The Library Council offers a variety of activities that develop communication
skills through language, vocal sounds, gestures, and facial and physical
expressions.</p>
<p>Students play icebreaker games such as ‘charades’ and ‘broken telephone’
which help them understand their friends in the CCA better.</p>
<p>Students learn to work collaboratively when they are introduced to board
games such as ‘Scrabble’, ‘Taboo’,&nbsp; ‘Speaking and Listening’ and other
board games.&nbsp; These games broaden their scope of vocabulary and improve
their English as well. For those who like to challenge their brains, there
are word puzzles and brain teaser activities.</p>
<p>To nurture Readers for Life, students go on a Learning Journey to one
of the libraries managed by the National Library Board.</p>
<p>Selected students are provided with opportunities to share a story during
pre-assembly. The rest of them get to experience this during the CCA itself.
They choose a book they like and share the story with the library council
members.</p>
<p>Students are also exposed to writing and illustration competitions organized
by external organisations.</p>
<p>The students also help the school librarian with the shelving of the library
books occasionally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nurturing Innovation and Environmental Stewardship at Peiying Primary
School</p>
<p>The Science and Environment Club offers a comprehensive programme that
integrates scientific exploration with environmental consciousness. Through
engaging hands-on activities, members discover practical applications of
scientific concepts while developing critical thinking skills. Activities
such as aerodynamic paper aeroplane design and structural engineering challenges
with tower construction bring theoretical principles to life in meaningful
ways.</p>
<p>The club's commitment to excellence is demonstrated through participation
in zonal and national competitions. Our members regularly showcase their
innovative solutions at the annual zonal Elementz Competition and the annual
STEM Playground Challenges that take place twice a year, where they present
creative solutions to real-world problems through collaborative projects
and artefacts.</p>
<p>Environmental sustainability forms a core focus of our programme. Through
programmes such as the bio-cleaner and insect superhero workshops, students
gained valuable insights into sustainable practices and environmental conservation.
The club's collaboration with the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) continues
to be synergistic, with members participating in the mushroom workshop
to deepen their understanding of sustainable food sources before contributing
as environmental champions, influencing their peers and fostering a culture
of environmental awareness.</p>
<p>We take pride in our members' consistent participation in the Young Scientist
Cards programme. Their dedication has earned them recognition through the
"Young Botanists", “Young Environmentalists” and "Water Ambassadors" badges
awarded, reflecting their good understanding of botanical sciences and
conservation principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these diverse learning experiences, the Science and Environment
Club cultivates not only scientific literacy but also environmental consciousness
among our members. The programme empowers our members to be responsible
stewards of the environment while developing their capacity for innovation
and problem-solving.&nbsp;</p>
