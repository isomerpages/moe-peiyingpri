Our students’ artwork titled, “Daily Reflections” was awarded the Certificate of Recognition. This artwork was also selected and exhibited at SCAPE in conjunction with the Singapore Youth Festival 2017. At this event, the students had opportunities to present and share their artwork to other participants.
