Peiying Primary School offers Angklung as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) to our P3 to P6 boys and girls. The Angklung Ensemble consists of students of different races playing traditional ethnic instruments from Indonesia. Angklung members learn to play different instruments and perform various repertoires of songs and melodies. They perform at important school events, such as Chinese New Year Celebration, National Day Celebration and Prize Presentation Day.

They have also participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) since 2010 and have consistently achieved accolades at the competition.

The Angklung Ensemble aims to develop students’ musical skills and instil our core PRIDE values in our members, through their appreciation for music. Angklung members are also given ample opportunities to perform on stage to showcase their talents.

Teachers-in-charge: Ms Mary Or, Mrs Chan Khai Hong and Mr Hendra
