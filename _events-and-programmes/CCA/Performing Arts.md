<p>Peiying Primary School offers the Angklung Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)
for P3 to P6 students, where they come together to explore traditional
Indonesian music through the Angklung and other ethnic instruments. Students
develop their musical skills and appreciation for different cultures while
performing various songs and melodies.</p>
<p>The ensemble regularly performs at school events like the Chinese New
Year and National Day Celebrations, and has consistently earned accolades
at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) since 2010.
In 2024, the Angklung Ensemble was awarded the Certificate of Distinction.</p>
<p>In addition to musical development, the Angklung Ensemble fosters our
school’s core values – PRIDE (Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence,
and Empathy) – in our students through teamwork and stage performances.
Join us to celebrate music, culture, and personal growth in a fun and supportive
environment!</p>

<p>At Peiying Primary School, the choir is a community that fosters creativity,
teamwork, and a love for music. The choir is open to Primary 3 to Primary
6 students who are passionate about singing and are eager to develop their
vocal skills while learning the power of collaboration. Our choir program
focuses on both individual growth and group harmony, providing a platform
for students to express themselves musically and socially.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of our dedicated music director, students explore a
variety of musical genres, from classical and pop to traditional and contemporary
choral music. This diversity allows students to expand their musical knowledge
and adapt their voices to different styles. Regular practices provide students
with the opportunity to refine their technique, build confidence, and perfect
the art of harmonising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performances are an integral part of the choir experience. Our choir showcases
their hard work and dedication to the school community annually during
the National Day Celebration and Prize Presentation Day. Each performance
is a celebration of the students' commitment, discipline, and the joy of
sharing music with others. Our Choir has also participated in the Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) and achieved a Certificate of
Accomplishment in 2024.</p>
<p>Joining the choir is a journey of artistic expression, friendship, and
unforgettable memories. We invite all students to join the choir and discover
the power of their own voices while contributing to the vibrant music culture
at our school.</p>

forms. Through performances at both internal and external events, they
