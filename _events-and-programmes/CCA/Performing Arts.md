<p>Peiying Primary School offers the Angklung Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)
for P3 to P6 students, where they come together to explore traditional
Indonesian music through the Angklung and other ethnic instruments. Students
develop their musical skills and appreciation for different cultures while
performing various songs and melodies.</p>
<p>The ensemble regularly performs at school events like the Chinese New
Year and National Day Celebrations, and has consistently earned accolades
at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP) since 2010.
In 2024, the Angklung Ensemble was awarded the Certificate of Distinction.</p>
<p>In addition to musical development, the Angklung Ensemble fosters our
school’s core values – PRIDE (Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence,
and Empathy) – in our students through teamwork and stage performances.
Join us to celebrate music, culture, and personal growth in a fun and supportive
environment!</p>
