<p>Peiying Primary School offers Brownies as a vibrant Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA) for our Primary 3 to Primary 6 girls. The Peiying Brownies embark
on exciting adventures together, fostering independence, curiosity, and
a love for discovery. They are encouraged to explore the world around them
while developing essential life skills and values.</p>
<p>Our Brownies participate in meaningful joint activities with other Brownie
and Girl Guide units, such as Division Days and World Thinking Day, creating
opportunities for shared learning and fun. The Peiying Brownies pack is
proud to have been awarded the prestigious Puan Noor Aishah Award for over
15 consecutive years. Additionally, they have achieved remarkable success
in various competitions at both division and national levels.</p>
<p>Through earning interest and proficiency badges, Brownies cultivate new
skills and build self-confidence. They also develop strong friendships
and values that prepare them to thrive in an ever-changing world. Joining
the Peiying Brownies is not just about learning—it's about growing, bonding,
and creating lifelong memories.</p>
<p>Brownies are guided by a comprehensive 5-Point Programme, which develops
them in 5 areas:</p>
