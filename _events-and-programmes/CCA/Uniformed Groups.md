<p>Peiying Primary School offers Red Cross as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)
to our P3 to P6 boys and girls. Peiying Primary School Red Cross Youth
(Links) focuses on building leadership, compassion, and community service.</p>
<p>Our Links participate in various competitions such as the First Aid and
Disaster Risk Reduction Championships, where they demonstrate their knowledge
and skills in emergency response and disaster preparedness. Through these
competitions, they strengthen their understanding of first aid and gain
valuable hands-on experience.</p>
<p>The CCA also engages in service to the school, particularly on Sports
Day, where Red Cross members provide first aid support to participants.
Enrichment activities foster strong peer support relationships, helping
students build a sense of teamwork and empathy. Additionally, the CCA organizes
visits to the Sree Narayana Mission, bringing joy and companionship to
the elderly.</p>
<p>Guided by the motto "To Serve, To Lead, To Shine," Red Cross empowers
students to be proactive leaders in their communities, making a positive
impact wherever they go.</p>
