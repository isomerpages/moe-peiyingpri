Peiying Primary School offers Brownies as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) to our P3 to P6 girls.&nbsp;Peiying Brownies enjoy learning and having amazing adventures together. Brownies are encouraged to explore and discover the world around them and become more independent. They are constantly learning new skills and challenged to try new and adventurous activities that will inspire them to think about what they want to be and do in the future.&nbsp;Activities include Division Days and outdoor cooking.

It is a co-curricular activity (CCA) that integrates character-building, leadership, essential lifesaving skills and knowledge in its curriculum. It brings out the best of our Links and to prepare them for leadership in their families and communities. This is in line with the Ministry of Education’s approach of developing 21st Century competencies among the youths, focusing on character and citizenship education.

Links are groomed to become good citizens with strong senses of civic responsibility. They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.
