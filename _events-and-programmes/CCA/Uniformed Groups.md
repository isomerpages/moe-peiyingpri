<p>Peiying Primary School offers Brownies as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)
to our P3 to P6 girls.&nbsp;Peiying Brownies enjoy learning and having
amazing adventures together. Brownies are encouraged to explore and discover
the world around them and become more independent. They are constantly
learning new skills and challenged to try new and adventurous activities
that will inspire them to think about what they want to be and do in the
future.&nbsp;Activities include Division Days and outdoor cooking.</p>
