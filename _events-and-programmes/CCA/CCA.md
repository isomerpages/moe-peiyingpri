### **CCA**
##### **Overview**
CCAs is an important aspect of the curriculum to build skills and values in our students. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing skills, values and social emotional competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. Students from diverse backgrounds come together to develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community. This helps the student to lead a balanced life in adulthood.

At Peiying Primary School, every Primary 3 to Primary 6 student takes part in one CCA from the following four CCA categories:
