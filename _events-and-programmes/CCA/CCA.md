<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>CCAs play a vital role in developing students’ skills, values, and social-emotional
competencies. They provide opportunities to explore interests, build friendships,
and foster a strong sense of belonging. Through CCAs, students gain valuable
experiences that prepare them for a dynamic future while cultivating a
balanced and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>The school offers a total of 15 CCAs in the following four groupings:</p>

<p>CCA Recruitment</p>

<p>At the end of Primary Two, students will get to find out more about the
various CCAs during the P2 CCA Experience Day. They will then be given
a form <a href="https://forms.moe.edu.sg/forms/vEagMk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>online</u></a> to
select their choices. Students are encouraged to discuss their choices
of CCA with their parents before submitting their CCA choices.</p>
<p>The school will try to assign the CCAs according to students’ preference.
However, there may be instances when students may not be assigned their
first choice CCA if it is over-subscribed. In such cases, they will be
assigned to one of their remaining choices of CCA.</p>
