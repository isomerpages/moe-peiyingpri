<h3><strong>CCA</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Overview</strong></h5>
<p>CCAs is an important aspect of the curriculum to build skills and values
in our students.&nbsp;Through CCA, students discover their interests and
talents while developing skills, values and social emotional competencies
that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world.&nbsp;Students from
diverse backgrounds come together to develop friendships and deepen their
sense of belonging to the school and community.&nbsp;This helps the student
to lead a balanced life in adulthood.</p>
<p>At Peiying Primary School, every Primary 3 to Primary 6 student takes
part in one CCA from the following four CCA categories:</p>

<h5><strong>Participation in CCA</strong></h5>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to participate actively in their CCA
to develop their interests and talents. Students who display talents in
their CCA may be selected to represent the school for competitions.</p>
<h5><strong>CCA Recruitment</strong></h5>
<p>At the end of Primary Two, students will get to find out more about the
various CCAs. They will then be given a form to select their choices. Students
are encouraged to discuss their choices of CCA with their parents before
submitting their CCA choices.</p>
<p>The school will try to assign the CCAs according to studentâ€™ preference.
However, there may be instances when students may not be assigned their
first choice CCA if it is over-subscribed. In such cases, they will be
assigned to one of their remaining choices of CCA.</p>
