### **CCA**
##### **Overview**
CCAs is an important aspect of the curriculum to build skills and values in our students. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing skills, values and social emotional competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. Students from diverse backgrounds come together to develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community. This helps the student to lead a balanced life in adulthood.

At Peiying Primary School, every Primary 3 to Primary 6 student takes part in one CCA from the following four CCA categories:

|  |  |
|:---:|:---:|
| **Sports and Games**<br>Netball, Outdoor Adventure Club, Rope Skipping,<br>Sepak Takraw, Volleyball | **Performing Arts**<br>Angklung, Choir, Modern Dance |
| **Uniformed Groups**<br>Brownies, Red Cross | **Clubs and Societies**<br>Art Club, Infocomm Club, Library Council, Photography Club, Physical Science Club |
|

##### **Participation in CCA**
Students are strongly encouraged to participate actively in their CCA to develop their interests and talents. Students who display talents in their CCA may be selected to represent the school for competitions.

##### **CCA Recruitment**
At the end of Primary Two, students will get to find out more about the various CCAs. They will then be given a form to select their choices. Students are encouraged to discuss their choices of CCA with their parents before submitting their CCA choices.

The school will try to assign the CCAs according to student’ preference. However, there may be instances when students may not be assigned their first choice CCA if it is over-subscribed. In such cases, they will be assigned to one of their remaining choices of CCA.
