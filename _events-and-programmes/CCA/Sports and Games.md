Peiying Primary School offers Netball as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) to our P3 to P6 girls. The weekly training sessions not only offer a platform where our girlsâ€™ sporting interests and talents are recognised and developed, it also offers opportunities to grow the girls in their character, social and emotional competencies, and 21 Century Competencies.

P5 and P6 school team players will represent the school in the National School Games Netball Championships and other platforms to apply the skills, knowledge and attitudes acquired.
