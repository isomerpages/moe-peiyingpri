Peiying Primary School offers Netball as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) to our P3 to P6 girls. The weekly training sessions not only offer a platform where our girls’ sporting interests and talents are recognised and developed, it also offers opportunities to grow the girls in their character, social and emotional competencies, and 21 Century Competencies.
