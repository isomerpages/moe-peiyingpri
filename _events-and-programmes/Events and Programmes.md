### **Events and Programmes**
#### **NE Show 2022**
On 2nd July 2022, 180 Primary 5 students and 12 staff attended the National Education (NE) Show which was a preview of National Day Parade 2022. This year, the NE Show was held at The Float @ Marina Bay with Singapore’s city skyline as its magnificent backdrop. The theme for this year’s NDP is “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**”

The theme, “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**” is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as strong, united people towards a better future. “Stronger Together” also reminds us that our unity in diversity is what makes us stronger.

Our students viewed a showcase of Singapore’s defence capabilities and enjoyed the Singapore Story depicted by a colourful display of sights and sounds. For many students, it was their first time watching the NDP at the venue itself. The NE Show had certainly evoked a sense of patriotism amongst our students and imparted the significance of our National Day Parade to them.

#### **P4 Cultural Experience**

With relaxed safe management measures, the much-awaited P4 Cultural Experience took place on 13 July 2022.

Our Primary 4 students went for an eye-opening cultural experience to Kampung Glam. The purpose of the programme is to provide the experience for our students to appreciate the diversity of cultures and heritage in Singapore.&nbsp;

Our students learnt to identify spices used in local recipes, went on a walking trail around Kampung Glam and tried their hands at batik painting at the Aliwal Arts Centre. Everyone was amazed with the art pieces done by our students. We never knew we had so many budding artists! It was also a good opportunity for bonding among schoolmates and they got to develop character values and life skills.
