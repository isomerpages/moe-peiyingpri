<h4>P1 Orientation</h4>
<p>On 10 November 2023, our school organised an orientation to welcome our
2024 Primary 1 students and for them and their parents to learn more about
the school and expectations to help them ease the transition and have a
great start to Primary School. Through the activities guided by the teachers
and student leaders, our incoming Primary 1 students had the chance to
know each other and to foster relationships among the students. While the
students were engaged in the classroom activities, their parents attended
a sharing by our Principal and Year Head on what to expect in Primary School,
how to prepare their child for Primary 1, and building school-home partnership.
After the briefing, students and parents had a school tour and visited
our Media Resource Library and PRIDE Garden.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing all our Primary 1 students on 2 January 2024!</p>

<h4>Children's Day Celebration</h4>
<p>In line with this year’s theme for Children’s Day - Be Active! Be Inclusive!,
exciting activities were organised for our students across all levels.
Supported by the PSG, our Primary 1 and 2 students had great fun at the
Lower Primary Games Day. Primary 3 and 4 students gained valuable leadership
skills and ‘Code for Fun’ while our Primary 5 students were thrilled to
learn and perform ethnic fusion and hip-hop dance to stay active. Lastly,
our Primary 6 students learnt about teamwork and inclusivity through the
‘ESCAPE! Room’ activity. The series of challenges in the activity created
opportunities for them to show care and concern for their peers and also
on goal setting and time management. Our students had a fun-filled and
enriching Children’s Day celebration!</p>
<h4>Teachers' Day Celebration</h4>
<p>We celebrated Teachers’ and Staff Day on 31 August. The theme for this
year’s celebration is “You Have Superpowers”! We acknowledge that every
staff in the school has their unique strengths and extraordinary abilities
in nurturing our students and creating a conducive school environment for
the students to develop into motivated and appreciative lifelong learners.
The whole school gathered and celebrated together in the hall. Performance
items were put up by our students and Parents Support Group to show their
appreciation to staff. The highlight of the day was the walk-in segment,
where students cheered loudly when their teachers entered the hall holding
the bouquet of flowers made by them!</p>
<p>It was an enjoyable event and a fitting end to the term.</p>

<h4>National Day Celebration</h4>
<p>This year’s National Day theme ‘Onward As One’ calls upon Singaporeans
to look forward confidently and move onward together in building our shared
future as one united people. As part of the National Day celebrations in
school, interactive activity stations were set up during recess on August
3, 2023. Students were engaged in solving quizzes about Singapore and National
Day on iPads. They also indulged in colouring and captured memories at
the photo booth. CCE Ambassadors and National Day committee teachers organised
and facilitated the activities, ensuring a seamless experience for all
Peiying students.</p>
<p>During the National Day Ceremonial segment, students solemnly observed
the Colour Party bringing in the State flag and school flag with pride.
After which, the school celebrated Singapore’s birthday with the singing
of National Day songs and a Peiying Fashion Parade where teachers and students
paraded and danced down the hall to loud cheers from the whole school.</p>
<p>What an enjoyable day for all! Happy Birthday Singapore! May you stay
strong and resilient in the years to come!</p>

<h4>Racial Harmony Day</h4>
<p>In July, we commemorated Racial Harmony Day to remind everyone on the
importance of maintaining racial, religious harmony and tolerance among
the different communities in Singapore. Besides the meaningful and fun-filled
classroom discussions and assembly programme, students were introduced
to different cultural motifs and their meanings during recess activities.
With the great support of our school’s Parent Support Group members and
our very own CCE ambassadors, students were guided to colour the motifs
to form collages, which aptly ties in with this year’s theme, “Our Multicultural
Mosaic”.</p>

<h4>English Language Fiesta</h4>
<p>The English Language department had organised the English Language (EL)
Fiesta from 30 March to 28 April 2023 to encourage students to read widely
and be confident speakers. An array of events and activities were curated
for the different levels, as well as those for the whole school. This year,
the school had invited Mdm Cheng Puay Koon, our School Advisory Committee
member and illustrator of a P2 STELLAR unit ‘Roti Prata’ to read and draw
with the P2 students. In addition, the school invited students and staff
to come to school dressed in the theme of ‘Superheroes’ on 31 March 2023.
It was heartening to see the students dressed in characters such as princes,
princesses and superheroes from the storybooks they like.
<br>
<br>To further encourage the love of reading, some of our students from P3
to P6 were invited to share their favourite stories during the Pre-Assembly
periods. This activity had certainly captivated the students as they listened
to the storybook reviews and excerpts of stories. The promotion of a reading
culture is one of the cornerstones of the school and the EL Fiesta brings
about the joy of reading through the activities designed for the students.</p>

<h4>Annual Track and Field Meet</h4>
<p>We had our Annual Track and Field Meet (P3 to P6) on 7 March 2023 at Yishun
Stadium. All students had the opportunity to participate in at least one
relay event competing with other houses in the same level.
<br>
<br>The event was met with enthusiasm and excitement from the students as
they participated in the various track and field events such as 4x100m
Relay, Baton Relay, Ladder Running Relay, Long Rope Skipping Relay and
Egg Spoon Relay.
<br>
<br>The event’s goal was to apply the motor skills learnt in Athletics in
the PE syllabus to cultivate our PRIDE values as well as to promote our
school’s vision – Lifelong Learners, Leaders of Character. It also developed
the camaraderie in students as they compete, cheer on their house mates
and interact with their peers. We are confident that such sports opportunities
in school will motivate the students to go on to pursue other sports-related
endeavors in the future.</p>

<h4>P5 Camp</h4>
<p>Our Primary 5 students attended the Outdoor Adventure Camp from 13-15
February 2023. The 3 days 2 nights camp was held at the MOE Dairy Farm
Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. Led by MOE’s Outdoor Adventure Educators
(OAEs) and teachers, our students had the opportunity to experience learning
through a variety of activities. These include the challenge rope course,
team building activities, stream exploration and many more! The highlight
of the camp was definitely the night walk, whereby students trekked through
Dairy Farm Nature Park with just the moonlight illuminating the way.</p>
<p>Through this camp, our students were actively engaged cognitively, physically
and affectively with the learning environment. They were also put in challenging
situations where they developed resilience and courage. It was an unforgettable
experience for the students and it will definitely stay with them for a
long time.</p>

<h4>Chinese New Year Celebration</h4>
<p>It has been a while since we were able to celebrate Chinese New Year together.
In the days leading up to the celebrations, our teachers and students worked
together to decorate the classrooms.</p>
<p>This year, we were delighted to welcome the year of the Rabbit with a
face-to-face concert and a Lion Dance performance. Our teachers and students
were entertained by the lion dance with many students eager to touch the
lion and interact with the rabbit! They also enjoyed the Wushu performance
put up by our very own student and the Peiying CNY Mass Dance choregraphed
by our Mother Tongue Language teachers. We ended the concert with a joyous
Sing-along session. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As we hop into the Year of the Rabbit, we would like to take this opportunity
to wish everyone a Happy and Prosperous Chinese New Year.</p>

<h4>Our P1’s First Day of School</h4>
<p>It was an exciting day for our P1 students and their parents on their
first day of school in Peiying Primary! Our P1 students were welcomed by
teachers as they entered the school feeling excited and anxious at the
same time. They were engaged in class activities and got to know their
form and co-form teachers and their new classmates. Parents were invited
to join their child and bond over food during recess time. Some managed
to squeeze in some time to explore the school ground together after they
had finished eating. At around 1 pm, it was time for our P1 students to
go home. The students waved excitedly when they saw their parents at the
school gate.</p>
