<p><strong><u>English Language Fiesta</u></strong>
</p>
<p>From 28 March to 26 April 2024, the school organised the English Language
Reading Fiesta to encourage students to read widely and be confident speakers.
A range of month-long activities was organised for the student. On the
launch of the English Language Fiesta, both the school staff and students
were encouraged to dress as their beloved book characters, with the aim
to enhance the joy of reading while nurturing creativity, critical thinking,
and a stronger bond with the stories they cherish. Through the Fiesta activities,
the school hopes to cultivate a community of engaged learners, sparking
an enthusiasm for literacy.</p>
<p><strong><u>P1 Choral Reading Presentation and Read@Peiying</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To foster a love for reading and language, this year, our Primary One
students were given the opportunity to do a choral reading presentation
to their cohort friends and parents in school. It was a great platform
to engage our students in reading together while also developing their
language skills, confidence, and teamwork.</p>
<p>Parents of our Primary One students were also invited for our Read@Peiying
event. The English Department, in collaboration with the Mother Tongue
Department and School Library, provided resources and support for parents
to read with their child and enjoy story time together in the school. Some
of our parents were also dressed in their favourite book characters. Everyone
had a fantastic time reading with their parents!</p>
<p>We would like to encourage parents to continue reading with your child!
Spark a love for reading by sharing stories with them regularly.</p>

<h3>Total Defence Day</h3>
<p>On 15 February 2024, our school observed a significant milestone: the
40th anniversary of Total Defence in Singapore. It's a day etched in our
hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation during challenging
times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, both students and staff immersed themselves
in an energy disruption simulation. Imagine the hum of electricity fading
away as the clocks struck 8.00 am, plunging our school into temporary darkness
until 9.00 am. It was a tangible reminder of our vulnerability, given Singapore's
dependence on fuel imports and the potential disruptions it could entail.</p>
<p>Through this exercise, we aimed to equip our students with the readiness
to face such disruptions, where we would need to prioritise the allocation
of electricity for critical sectors. It was a glimpse into a possible future
where households, including our schools, might have to adapt to such challenges.</p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights with their peers. It's not just about
experiencing the simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity
and resilience within our school community, echoing the spirit of Total
Defence that has sustained our nation for four decades.</p>

<h3>Cyber-wellness Week</h3>
<p>The Student Management Department orchestrated a dynamic Cyber Wellness
Week from 5 February to 8 February, bursting with engaging activities.
This year's theme is on fostering responsible digital habits and managing
screen time. With a spotlight on the detrimental effects of excessive screen
exposure on mental and physical well-being, particularly among our youth,
the event aimed to ignite awareness and spark action for Cyber Wellness.</p>
<p>From captivating assembly talks to vibrant Cyber Wellness information
board displays stationed in the library, students were immersed in an interactive
journey to learn about Cyber Wellness. Quizzes challenged their knowledge,
while reflective sessions prompted deep introspection.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal? To empower our students to navigate the digital landscape
with confidence and discernment, making choices that prioritise their well-being.</p>

<h3>First Day of School</h3>
<p>Embarking on a new journey with excitement and smiles! Our P1 students
kicked off their first day at school with a mix of emotions. Waving goodbyes
to their parents at the school hall, they walked to their classrooms under
the care of their Form Teachers and engaged in fun activities with their
teachers and friends in the classrooms. The P1 students swiftly embraced
the primary school experience and settled into the new environment.</p>
<p>They were happy to have their first recess with their parents and were
eager to explore the food options in the school canteen. A day brimming
with smiles and fresh beginnings! Before they knew it, the school bell
signaled the end of the day. Our P1 students looked forward to reuniting
with their families, with some anticipating their very first school bus
ride or immersing themselves in the student care experience. Wishing all
our P1 students the best on this exciting journey ahead!</p>

<h3>P1 Orientation</h3>
<p>On 10 November 2023, our school organised an orientation to welcome our
2024 Primary 1 students and for them and their parents to learn more about
the school and expectations to help them ease the transition and have a
great start to Primary School. Through the activities guided by the teachers
and student leaders, our incoming Primary 1 students had the chance to
know each other and to foster relationships among the students. While the
students were engaged in the classroom activities, their parents attended
a sharing by our Principal and Year Head on what to expect in Primary School,
how to prepare their child for Primary 1, and building school-home partnership.
After the briefing, students and parents had a school tour and visited
our Media Resource Library and PRIDE Garden.</p>

learn and perform ethnic fusion and hip-hop dance to stay active. Lastly,
