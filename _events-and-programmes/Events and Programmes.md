<h3><strong>Events and Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4>Track and Field Meet</h4>
<p>The vibrant atmosphere of excitement filled the air as students, teachers,
and parents gathered at Yishun Stadium for our Annual Track and Field Meet
on 1st March 2024.</p>
<p>The day kicked off with a march pass, as each house team proudly marched
onto the track, donning their distinct house colours. Cheers and chants
echoed across the stadium, igniting a sense of camaraderie and sportsmanship
among the participants.</p>
<p>The annual Track and Field Meet was a medley of fun-filled events, catering
to the diverse interests and talents of the students. From traditional
track and field races like sprints and relays to unconventional games like
ladder running and long rope skipping. There was something for everyone
to enjoy. The cheers of encouragement from classmates and teachers echoed
through the field, uplifting the spirits of the participants and fueling
their determination to do their best.</p>
<p>Amidst the fierce competition, it was heartwarming to witness the bonds
of friendship and support that flourished throughout the day, transcending

<h4>Total Defence Day</h4>
<p>On 15 February 2024, our school observed a significant milestone: the
40th anniversary of Total Defence in Singapore. It's a day etched in our
hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation during challenging
times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, both students and staff immersed themselves
in an energy disruption simulation. Imagine the hum of electricity fading
away as the clocks struck 8.00 am, plunging our school into temporary darkness
until 9.00 am. It was a tangible reminder of our vulnerability, given Singapore's
dependence on fuel imports and the potential disruptions it could entail.</p>
<p>Through this exercise, we aimed to equip our students with the readiness
to face such disruptions, where we would need to prioritise the allocation
of electricity for critical sectors. It was a glimpse into a possible future
where households, including our schools, might have to adapt to such challenges.</p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights with their peers. It's not just about
experiencing the simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity
and resilience within our school community, echoing the spirit of Total
Defence that has sustained our nation for four decades.</p>

<h4>Chinese New Year Celebration</h4>
<p>Peiying welcomed the Year of the Dragon with a blast this year with an
exciting lineup of Chinese New Year activities for the students.</p>
<p>Students were engaged in interesting classroom activities at the start
of the day. The mass dance involvement by the whole school also added much
vibrancy to the occasion. Another highlight for this year’s CNY celebrations
included Wushu and Dance performances by our very own Peiying talents!</p>
<p>We ended the school celebrations on a high note, with the arrival of both
the Dragon and Lion Dance troupes. Students were exhilarated to see them
in our school hall!</p>
<p>Here’s wishing everyone a joyous and smooth Dragon year ahead!</p>

<h4>Cyber-wellness Week</h4>
<p>The Student Management Department orchestrated a dynamic Cyber Wellness
Week from 5 February to 8 February, bursting with engaging activities.
This year's theme is on fostering responsible digital habits and managing
screen time. With a spotlight on the detrimental effects of excessive screen
exposure on mental and physical well-being, particularly among our youth,
the event aimed to ignite awareness and spark action for Cyber Wellness.</p>
<p>From captivating assembly talks to vibrant Cyber Wellness information
board displays stationed in the library, students were immersed in an interactive
journey to learn about Cyber Wellness. Quizzes challenged their knowledge,
while reflective sessions prompted deep introspection.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal? To empower our students to navigate the digital landscape
with confidence and discernment, making choices that prioritise their well-being.</p>

<h4>First Day of School</h4>
<p>Embarking on a new journey with excitement and smiles! Our P1 students
kicked off their first day at school with a mix of emotions. Waving goodbyes
to their parents at the school hall, they walked to their classrooms under
the care of their Form Teachers and engaged in fun activities with their
teachers and friends in the classrooms. The P1 students swiftly embraced
the primary school experience and settled into the new environment.</p>
<p>They were happy to have their first recess with their parents and were
eager to explore the food options in the school canteen. A day brimming
with smiles and fresh beginnings! Before they knew it, the school bell
signaled the end of the day. Our P1 students looked forward to reuniting
with their families, with some anticipating their very first school bus
ride or immersing themselves in the student care experience. Wishing all
our P1 students the best on this exciting journey ahead!</p>

<h4>P1 Orientation</h4>
<p>On 10 November 2023, our school organised an orientation to welcome our
2024 Primary 1 students and for them and their parents to learn more about
the school and expectations to help them ease the transition and have a
great start to Primary School. Through the activities guided by the teachers
and student leaders, our incoming Primary 1 students had the chance to
know each other and to foster relationships among the students. While the
students were engaged in the classroom activities, their parents attended
a sharing by our Principal and Year Head on what to expect in Primary School,
how to prepare their child for Primary 1, and building school-home partnership.
After the briefing, students and parents had a school tour and visited
our Media Resource Library and PRIDE Garden.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing all our Primary 1 students on 2 January 2024!</p>

<h4>Children's Day Celebration</h4>
<p>In line with this year’s theme for Children’s Day - Be Active! Be Inclusive!,
exciting activities were organised for our students across all levels.
Supported by the PSG, our Primary 1 and 2 students had great fun at the
Lower Primary Games Day. Primary 3 and 4 students gained valuable leadership
skills and ‘Code for Fun’ while our Primary 5 students were thrilled to
learn and perform ethnic fusion and hip-hop dance to stay active. Lastly,
our Primary 6 students learnt about teamwork and inclusivity through the
‘ESCAPE! Room’ activity. The series of challenges in the activity created
opportunities for them to show care and concern for their peers and also
on goal setting and time management. Our students had a fun-filled and
enriching Children’s Day celebration!</p>
<h4>Teachers' Day Celebration</h4>
<p>We celebrated Teachers’ and Staff Day on 31 August. The theme for this
year’s celebration is “You Have Superpowers”! We acknowledge that every
staff in the school has their unique strengths and extraordinary abilities
in nurturing our students and creating a conducive school environment for
the students to develop into motivated and appreciative lifelong learners.
The whole school gathered and celebrated together in the hall. Performance
items were put up by our students and Parents Support Group to show their
appreciation to staff. The highlight of the day was the walk-in segment,
where students cheered loudly when their teachers entered the hall holding
the bouquet of flowers made by them!</p>
<p>It was an enjoyable event and a fitting end to the term.</p>

<h4>National Day Celebration</h4>
<p>This year’s National Day theme ‘Onward As One’ calls upon Singaporeans
to look forward confidently and move onward together in building our shared
future as one united people. As part of the National Day celebrations in
school, interactive activity stations were set up during recess on August
3, 2023. Students were engaged in solving quizzes about Singapore and National
Day on iPads. They also indulged in colouring and captured memories at
the photo booth. CCE Ambassadors and National Day committee teachers organised
and facilitated the activities, ensuring a seamless experience for all
Peiying students.</p>
<p>During the National Day Ceremonial segment, students solemnly observed
the Colour Party bringing in the State flag and school flag with pride.
After which, the school celebrated Singapore’s birthday with the singing
of National Day songs and a Peiying Fashion Parade where teachers and students
paraded and danced down the hall to loud cheers from the whole school.</p>
<p>What an enjoyable day for all! Happy Birthday Singapore! May you stay
strong and resilient in the years to come!</p>

<h4>Racial Harmony Day</h4>
<p>In July, we commemorated Racial Harmony Day to remind everyone on the
importance of maintaining racial, religious harmony and tolerance among
the different communities in Singapore. Besides the meaningful and fun-filled
classroom discussions and assembly programme, students were introduced
to different cultural motifs and their meanings during recess activities.
With the great support of our school’s Parent Support Group members and
our very own CCE ambassadors, students were guided to colour the motifs
to form collages, which aptly ties in with this year’s theme, “Our Multicultural
Mosaic”.</p>

<h4>English Language Fiesta</h4>
<p>The English Language department had organised the English Language (EL)
Fiesta from 30 March to 28 April 2023 to encourage students to read widely
and be confident speakers. An array of events and activities were curated
for the different levels, as well as those for the whole school. This year,
the school had invited Mdm Cheng Puay Koon, our School Advisory Committee
member and illustrator of a P2 STELLAR unit ‘Roti Prata’ to read and draw
with the P2 students. In addition, the school invited students and staff
to come to school dressed in the theme of ‘Superheroes’ on 31 March 2023.
It was heartening to see the students dressed in characters such as princes,
princesses and superheroes from the storybooks they like.
<br>
<br>To further encourage the love of reading, some of our students from P3
to P6 were invited to share their favourite stories during the Pre-Assembly
periods. This activity had certainly captivated the students as they listened
to the storybook reviews and excerpts of stories. The promotion of a reading
culture is one of the cornerstones of the school and the EL Fiesta brings
about the joy of reading through the activities designed for the students.</p>

<h4>Annual Track and Field Meet</h4>
<p>We had our Annual Track and Field Meet (P3 to P6) on 7 March 2023 at Yishun
Stadium. All students had the opportunity to participate in at least one
relay event competing with other houses in the same level.
<br>
<br>The event was met with enthusiasm and excitement from the students as
they participated in the various track and field events such as 4x100m
Relay, Baton Relay, Ladder Running Relay, Long Rope Skipping Relay and
Egg Spoon Relay.
<br>
<br>The event’s goal was to apply the motor skills learnt in Athletics in
the PE syllabus to cultivate our PRIDE values as well as to promote our
school’s vision – Lifelong Learners, Leaders of Character. It also developed
the camaraderie in students as they compete, cheer on their house mates
and interact with their peers. We are confident that such sports opportunities
in school will motivate the students to go on to pursue other sports-related
endeavors in the future.</p>

<h4>P5 Camp</h4>
<p>Our Primary 5 students attended the Outdoor Adventure Camp from 13-15
February 2023. The 3 days 2 nights camp was held at the MOE Dairy Farm
Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. Led by MOE’s Outdoor Adventure Educators
(OAEs) and teachers, our students had the opportunity to experience learning
through a variety of activities. These include the challenge rope course,
team building activities, stream exploration and many more! The highlight
of the camp was definitely the night walk, whereby students trekked through
Dairy Farm Nature Park with just the moonlight illuminating the way.</p>
<p>Through this camp, our students were actively engaged cognitively, physically
and affectively with the learning environment. They were also put in challenging
situations where they developed resilience and courage. It was an unforgettable
experience for the students and it will definitely stay with them for a
long time.</p>

<h4>Chinese New Year Celebration</h4>
<p>It has been a while since we were able to celebrate Chinese New Year together.
In the days leading up to the celebrations, our teachers and students worked
together to decorate the classrooms.</p>
<p>This year, we were delighted to welcome the year of the Rabbit with a
face-to-face concert and a Lion Dance performance. Our teachers and students
were entertained by the lion dance with many students eager to touch the
lion and interact with the rabbit! They also enjoyed the Wushu performance
put up by our very own student and the Peiying CNY Mass Dance choregraphed
by our Mother Tongue Language teachers. We ended the concert with a joyous
Sing-along session. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As we hop into the Year of the Rabbit, we would like to take this opportunity
to wish everyone a Happy and Prosperous Chinese New Year.</p>

<h4>Our P1’s First Day of School</h4>
<p>It was an exciting day for our P1 students and their parents on their
first day of school in Peiying Primary! Our P1 students were welcomed by
teachers as they entered the school feeling excited and anxious at the
same time. They were engaged in class activities and got to know their
form and co-form teachers and their new classmates. Parents were invited
to join their child and bond over food during recess time. Some managed
to squeeze in some time to explore the school ground together after they
had finished eating. At around 1 pm, it was time for our P1 students to
go home. The students waved excitedly when they saw their parents at the
school gate.</p>
