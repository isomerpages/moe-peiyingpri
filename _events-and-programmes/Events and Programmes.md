### **Events and Programmes**
#### **NE Show 2022**
On 2nd July 2022, 180 Primary 5 students and 12 staff attended the National Education (NE) Show which was a preview of National Day Parade 2022. This year, the NE Show was held at The Float @ Marina Bay with Singapore’s city skyline as its magnificent backdrop. The theme for this year’s NDP is “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**”

The theme, “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**” is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as strong, united people towards a better future. “Stronger Together” also reminds us that our unity in diversity is what makes us stronger.

Our students viewed a showcase of Singapore’s defence capabilities and enjoyed the Singapore Story depicted by a colourful display of sights and sounds. For many students, it was their first time watching the NDP at the venue itself. The NE Show had certainly evoked a sense of patriotism amongst our students and imparted the significance of our National Day Parade to them.

#### **P4 Cultural Experience**

With relaxed safe management measures, the much-awaited P4 Cultural Experience took place on 13 July 2022.

Our Primary 4 students went for an eye-opening cultural experience to Kampung Glam. The purpose of the programme is to provide the experience for our students to appreciate the diversity of cultures and heritage in Singapore.&nbsp;

Our students learnt to identify spices used in local recipes, went on a walking trail around Kampung Glam and tried their hands at batik painting at the Aliwal Arts Centre. Everyone was amazed with the art pieces done by our students. We never knew we had so many budding artists! It was also a good opportunity for bonding among schoolmates and they got to develop character values and life skills.

#### **Earth Month 2022**

Peiying Primary School commemorates Earth Day annually with a myriad of eco-friendly activities to emphasise the importance of environmental sustainability and eco-stewardship.

Students were given opportunities to champion environmentally friendly causes and one signature event is the Annual Upcycling Competition. This year, we received a record number of upcycled artefacts! This is a testament of how we can extend the life of existing resources instead of wasting them. With our creativity, we can even come up with unique and interesting masterpieces! We hope to be an inspiration to others to practice upcycling in their daily lives.

We also touched on focus topics such as the Energy Crisis we are facing, on top of Global Warming and Climate Change. For an authentic and impactful learning experience, we had a ‘10-minute electricity-free’ moment where all classes turned off the lights and fans. This taught students to appreciate the comfort and convenience electricity has been bringing us, and to be responsible users so that there would still be electricity for generations to come!

This year, we also had a school-community collaboration with Nee Soon South CC. Our school initiated a mini upcycled Origami Trash Bin project. All staff, students, parents and members of the Parents-Support-Group folded more than 4,500 pieces of origami trash bins made from used paper.&nbsp;

The Grassroot Advisor for Nee Soon South, Ms Carrie Tan, as well as four other grassroot leaders, visited our school on 4 May 2022 to join and support us in our community outreach efforts. Together with a class of students, they had a fun time folding origami trash bins!

These origami trash bins will soon be distributed at the food centres in Nee Soon South. We hope to kickstart a ‘Bring-Your-Own-Bin’ movement within our community where members of the public embrace the joy of ‘a simple act of upcycling’ that can also keep our dining spaces clean for the comfort of everyone!

#### **International Friendship Day 2022**
Peiying Primary School commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on 4th April 2022.The Chair for 2022 is Cambodia, so an emphasis was placed on the customs and traditions of the country.&nbsp; Not all the ten ASEAN countries were showcased due to time constraints. The PowerPoint presentation for the Assembly Period focused on Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar because of the similarities these countries shared with Singapore like the New Year and Dragon boat festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The theme for IFD 2022 was Singapore in Asia. There was information given about Singapore’s contribution to ASEAN countries during times of natural disasters and emergencies. The slides showed Singapore sending our soldiers, doctors, civil defence personnel, equipment, vaccines and financial aid to Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos and the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

For the CCE-FTGP lesson, the Primary One level did an activity to help them recognise the flags of the ASEAN countries. The Primary Two level learned greetings in different ASEAN country languages. The Primary Three level learned about the national flowers of the ASEAN countries. The Primary 4 to 6 countries had discussions on how ASEAN countries can help each other, how working as a cohesive community is beneficial and what commonalities ASEAN countries shared.&nbsp;

It was heartening to hear from various form teachers how the students recognised many of the flags and had meaningful conversations about how ASEAN countries need each other’s help in times of difficulties.

#### **Let’s Celebrate English with a Touch of Magic**
The annual English Language Fiesta was held on 28 March 2022 to 22 April 2022. It was organised by the English Department to encourage our students to speak good English, to be avid readers and to infuse creativity in their writing. This year’s theme was ‘Let’s Celebrate English with a Touch of Magic’. The students celebrated the English Language ‘with a touch of magic’ by participating in class activities like Readers’ Theatre, Poetry and Creative Writing. Guest readers were invited to share interesting stories held at the school library. The students also experienced ‘A Blind Date with a Book’.&nbsp;

On 1 April 2022, the staff and students were dressed up to the theme of ‘Magic and Enchantment’ and the school was filled with magical characters like fairies, wizards and witches. Our students were taken on a trip to their favourite magical wonderland where many book characters came alive in the school compound. These included storybook characters like Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and even Prince Charming. Instantly, Peiying Primary School was transformed into a land of magic!&nbsp; It was indeed a memorable event for the school.

#### **Friendship Week**
We commemorated Friendship Week on the first week of Term 2 (21 March 2022 - 1 April 2022). The theme for this year’s Friendship Week is Sustaining Friendships. The planned activities were a combined effort of the Art, MRL and CCE Departments. The activities aimed to strengthen peer support relationships among students.

It was a great opportunity for the students to show appreciation for their peers, and to foster stronger and more positive friendships. We started the week with an E-assembly talk. Primary 1 to Primary 3 students watched a skit - “We Can All Be Friends”, while Primary 4 to Primary 6 students learnt about “accepting our friends and their differences”.&nbsp;

Next, the students proceeded to make friendship bookmarks for their buddies in class. The students expressed their gratitude towards their buddies and exchanged their token of appreciation with one another. During recess, students also had the chance to explore books that were “friendship” themed! We hope that this Friendship Week would reinforce the importance of positive relationships built on trust, empathy and respect for one another.

#### **Peer Support Relationship in CCA**
Peer Support Relationships (PSR) initiative builds on our school's culture of care. It aims to create a supportive and caring environment so that our students would feel safe, accepted and empowered. All Peiying students were taught to be kind and caring, to identify their social circle of support, and recognise signs of distress between peers through our various PSR activities.&nbsp; This year, we extended the PSR activities to our CCAs. Through PSR in CCA, the students bonded with one another, and this strengthened their relationship with their fellow CCA members. They also learnt important skills like teamwork and communication as they participated in the games. At the end of the activities, they each chose a buddy and spent some time to get to know their buddy better.&nbsp; This PSR initiative has shown students that they are able to provide social and emotional support for one another, and it strongly resonates with our school’s belief that no child should be left behind.

#### **P3 and P4 Enrichment Programme**
With the aim of promoting oracy among students, the English department conducted several enrichment workshops for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students.  

Primary 3 students were engaged in Readers’ Theatre, which helped them to learn to express themselves appropriately, confidently, clearly, eloquently and expressively. They were also taught a variety of vocal techniques to present their stories.  

Primary 4 students had the opportunity to do Public Speaking, which helped them to learn the right public speaking skills in order to become an empathetic and effective communicator. The workshop also helped them gain confidence and motivation in delivering a narrative through positive reinforcement.

#### **Chinese New Year Celebrations 2022**
The appreciation of the Chinese culture and traditions were the focus of our Chinese New Year Celebrations this year.&nbsp;

We kicked start the celebration with a Pre-CNY Level Decoration Competition two weeks before the Chinese New Year, to create a festive mood in the school.&nbsp;

During the school celebration on the eve of Chinese New Year, the students learnt about the need to persevere at this point of the pandemic, the importance of communication and the value of filial piety through videos and PowerPoint presentations prepared by our teachers. The students were also engaged in hands-on activities and brought their hand made products home to celebrate the Chinese New Year.

#### **Key Student Leaders’ Investiture Ceremony**
The Key Student Leaders’ Investiture Ceremony was held on 7 March 2022. This Investiture is held annually to formally appoint our Prefects and Junior Sports Leaders as key student leaders of the school.

This year’s ceremony was special as a livestream of the event was shown to the school community. Students and teachers were able to witness the formal appointment of our Key Student Leaders from their respective classrooms.

The Investiture was kick-started with a speech made by our 2022 Head Prefect and was followed by a speech from our Vice-Principal, Mr Abdul Rani. Both speeches reiterated the importance of demonstrating the school’s core values of PRIDE (Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence and Empathy) while carrying out their respective duties.

Besides receiving their respective badges, our key student leaders also received a Congratulatory Card. This card seeks to affirm the student leaders’ appointment to their roles and to congratulate parents of their child’s achievement.

#### **Cyberwellness Week 2022**
Cyber Safety was the focus for the Cyberwelless Week this year. Through a digital drama show, students were introduced to healthy cybersecurity habits and the importance of balanced screen time. Through participating in the school activities, they came to understand the risks involved when using digital devices and engaging in online activities. Besides acquiring knowledge of online safety rules, students learnt how to prevent unauthorised access to their devices and online accounts, and learnt to be better equipped at becoming a responsible and smart digital citizen.

Our Annual Prize Presentation Day is a joyous occasion which marks the end of the year 2021. Peiying Primary School celebrated the efforts and achievements of all our award recipients, both staff and students, on Friday 19 November 2021.&nbsp;

The theme for this year’s ceremony is “Best of Peiying”, which embodies the school’s mission in Building character, Enriching lives and Stretching PoTential to all in Peiying Primary School.&nbsp;

#### **Teachers’ Day Celebration 2021**
This year, Peiying Primary School celebrated Teachers’ Day with the theme “Celebrating the Selfless Giving of the Teachers”, inspired by the story “The Giving Tree”. The values of appreciating the selfless giving of others and paying forward the kindness received were inculcated in the students during the celebration.&nbsp;

The celebration was put together by the Teachers’ Day committee which consisted of the Allied Educators (AED) team, Executive and Administrative (EAS) team and the Celebration of Learning (COL) team from the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Though the Covid-19 pandemic restricted the way the celebration activities were carried out, it had not dampened the students’ spirits in wanting to show their heartfelt appreciations to their teachers. In the pre-celebration activities, the students wrote beautifully on how they were touched by the selfless giving of their teachers. The students in the lower primary level also drew gorgeous portraits of their teachers. Besides the students, the parents also wrote down their warm appreciations to the teachers via the various channels that were set up by the school as well as by the Ministry of Education on a national wide platform “Thank you ‘Cher”.&nbsp;

Understanding that the teachers and the non-teaching staff of Peiying had worked extra hard, to keep the school a clean and safe environment for the students to continue their learning in the midst of the pandemic, a self-care bookmark was made and given to all the staff. The students wanted to remind the teachers and the non-teaching staff that they need to take care of themselves too.&nbsp;

The celebration ended with the students doing a COL activity on how they could pay it forward with the knowledge they learnt from to their teachers to make the environment a better place for everyone.

#### **Children’s Day Celebration 2021**
The school celebrated Children’s Day on 11 October 2021. As we celebrate Children’s Day in the new normal, we must all realise that we will face many challenges and uncertainties in the future. Hence, to build resilience and promote a culture of care in our students, our theme for this year’s Children’s Day celebration is “Together as One”.

The students were treated to a virtual concert performed by the teachers. Students enjoyed this segment of the celebration immensely. Much laughter and loud exclamations could be heard from every classroom. Feedback from teachers was that students were engaged and wished there were more items in the concert.

Our students also demonstrated the school’s core value of Empathy by donating their pocket money to the Children’s Day Appeal (CDA) which is an annual nationwide campaign by Community Chest. The CDA rallies students from pre-schools and primary schools to donate to help the less fortunate in the community and to develop the students into socially responsible citizens who will contribute meaningfully to the community.&nbsp;

There were also classroom activities planned for all levels. P1 and P2 students coloured greeting cards and presented them to their classmates. P3 and P4 students coloured bookmarks and wrote words of encouragement on them for their fellow classmates. P5 and P6 students designed cards and also wrote on the cards words of encouragement for their friends.

This year, the Children’s Day gift was a beautifully designed USB flash drive. It is a gift most welcomed by students as learning now involves more digital methodologies as technology advances.

#### **National Day 2021 - Celebrating The Singapore Spirit in Peiying**
On 6 August 2021, the school celebrated the nation’s 56th&nbsp;birthday in line with this year’s National Day theme, ‘_Together, Our Singapore Spirit’._&nbsp;The theme calls on Singaporeans to come together as one and draw new strength from our “can-do” spirit amidst challenging circumstances from COVID-19. We want to encourage our students to embrace a “dare-to-try” attitude. All students and staff wore red and/or white to express their pride towards Singapore on that day.

This year, in view of the pandemic, the Observance ceremony and celebration were carried out in the classrooms. An array of fun and engaging activities were organised for the students. Flag buntings with students’ well wishes were displayed outside their classrooms. National Day songs and this year’s virtual dance were among the favourite activities for the students. The school also prepared a&nbsp;_Stronger Together Pack_&nbsp;consists of a highlighter and a clipboard packed in a drawstring bag. &nbsp;

To show our gratitude to our stakeholders such as the canteen vendors, bookshop vendor and the cleaning attendants, a note of appreciation was written by each student. Through this celebration, we hope to have instilled a strong sense of national identity, pride and love for Singapore.

#### **Racial Harmony Day Celebrations @Peiying**
Racial Harmony Day was commemorated on the 19 July 2021. The theme for this year is ‘Common Spaces and Connected Communities’. Students were engaged in ‘Harmony @ School’ activities in the school. They gained understanding by reflecting on their experiences and engaging in respectful online and offline conversations. Students were also engaged in ‘Harmony @Home’ activities with parents through Family engagement activities. These activities will provide opportunities for students to protect their common spaces, strengthen trust and friendship among communities.&nbsp;

Students were encouraged to wear their ethnic costumes as it provides an opportunity to preserve their cultural heritage and creates a feeling of unity among them. Lastly, students recognized that candid and heartfelt conversations on diverse cultures and multicultural communities can enrich our lives if they are conducted respectfully and sensitively.

#### **P5 Camp 2021**
Our annual Primary 5 Camp has always been designed as a learning experience to develop our students’ character and leadership skills and at the same time, instill PRIDE values and Social and Emotional (SE) competencies skills as students interact with one another through community living away from home. Although campers were unable to overnight in school due to COVID-19 Safe Management Measures, the essence of the camp remained the same - a platform to discover their interests and talents in outdoor and adventure activities as well as fostering team spirit through well-crafted and meaningful activities.

Campers visited Low Elements at the Peiying Adventure Centre, participated in Team-Building games and Wushu as well as journeyed together around the school during the NE Trail and Virtual Orienteering. Many campers learnt to be more responsible and independent during the camp. Through the various activities, they also got to know their classmates better. The students’ reflections also revealed that the camp had helped them forge closer ties and build stronger friendships with their friends and teachers.&nbsp;

At the end of the camp, the students provided positive feedback about the camp and shared their learning experiences with their class mates and teachers.

With that, the objectives of the Primary 5 camp have been achieved. Onwards Peiying!

#### **Prize Presentation 2021**
On Monday, 1 March 2021, Peiying Primary School celebrated the success and achievements of students who have made academic progress and achieved character excellence during the Prize Presentation for the Primary 4, 5 and 6 students.&nbsp;

Although parents and students were not physically present in the school hall to witness the ceremony, the event was live-streamed and watched by all students in their respective classrooms. Invited parents of prize-winners were also able to witness the ceremony virtually.&nbsp;  

May our students embrace the spirit of life-long learning, be inspired by their friends' successes, continue to strive for excellence and continue to display our school PRIDE values.
