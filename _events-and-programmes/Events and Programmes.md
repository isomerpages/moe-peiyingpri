<p>Peiying Primary School is delighted to share our Term 4 Growth Mindset
programme, conducted in class by our dedicated form teachers. Centred on
the empowering theme “The Power of Yet,” the programme aims to nurture
resilience and cultivate positive learning attitudes across all levels.</p>
<p>The programme's learning objectives focused on helping students understand
the power of "yet" as a fundamental component of Growth Mindset. Students
learnt to recognise how incorporating "yet" into their vocabulary enables
them to embrace challenges and view setbacks as valuable opportunities
for learning and improvement. Through engaging and level-appropriate activities,
the programme fostered a school-wide culture that celebrates Growth Mindset
and progress for each student's learning journey.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 1 and 2</strong> students explored the concept through
a fun and meaningful <em>‘charades’</em> game, acting out things they could
not do <em>yet</em>. This helped them connect personally with the idea in
an enjoyable way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 3 and 4</strong> students participated in an interactive <em>‘Bingo’</em> game,
where teachers introduced challenging learning scenarios students could
relate to, encouraging reflection and discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary 5 and 6</strong> students took on the collaborative <em>‘Human Knot’</em> activity,
reinforcing the importance of teamwork, positive thinking, and tackling
challenges together.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This programme has successfully demonstrated how grit, teamwork, and a
positive attitude contribute to academic and personal success. More importantly,
it lays the foundation for our students to become confident, resilient
learners equipped for lifelong learning.</p>

<p>On 4 September 2025, our school celebrated Teachers’ Day with the inspiring
theme “Creating Magic Every Moment”. Our teachers and staff are constantly
attuned to the little things our students say and do. Each moment becomes
an opportunity - to encourage, to inspire, to bring out the best in our
students. Whether it is a kind word, a spark of curiosity ignited, or a
quiet act of care, our teachers and staff create magic in everyday moments,
transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary for our students.</p>
<p>The day’s celebrations were both heartfelt and joyful. The concert programme
featured an appreciation video and gratitude notes from parents, highlighting
the deep impact our staff have made. A high-energy drumming performance
by our talented Project Stars performers brought vibrance to the stage,
followed by the morning’s highlight - a spectacular comedy circus show
filled with dazzling acts that kept everyone captivated. In the classrooms,
students added their personal touch to the celebration by writing appreciation
notes to their teachers.</p>
<p>It was a memorable and meaningful way to honour our teachers and staff,
celebrate their efforts, and wrap up the term on a high note before a well-deserved
holiday break.</p>
<h4>Preventive Drug Education 2025 at Peiying Primary School</h4>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe height="500" width="800" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsuH-Eutq2XoEnl9UwpzWH8g6ZWj4F1ceG2x1eGJl62caAzt1hNy19-QVUBP2OHFC067Tkl-QJYm48/pubembed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>
</div>
<p>At Peiying Primary School, we believe in nurturing leaders of character
and caring citizens. As part of our commitment to holistic education and
student well-being, we implemented a series of meaningful initiatives under
the Preventive Drug Education 2025 programme. This year’s focus was on
three important learning points: (i) Understanding the harmful effects
of drug misuse (ii) Building confidence to say “NO” to drugs (iii) Developing
healthy ways to manage negative emotions.</p>
<p>The programme began with pre-assembly and assembly sessions that equipped
students with knowledge about the dangers of drugs and the importance of
making wise decisions. These were followed by interactive classroom activities
and recess campaigns, which encouraged peer discussions and reinforced
key takeaways in a fun and memorable way. Students also had the opportunity
to express their learning through creative poster design, sharing preventive
drug education messages. A meaningful ribbon-folding activity during recess
also allowed students to pledge their commitment to staying drug-free.</p>
<p>The campaign concluded with a school-wide showcase of student posters,
celebrating their voices and ideas. To strengthen home-school partnership,
a message was shared with parents via Parent Gateway, helping to extend
the conversation at home.</p>
<p>Through these collective efforts, we continue to empower our students
with the knowledge, skills, and values to thrive and to make safe, positive
choices for their future.</p>
<h4>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) 2025</h4>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe height="500" width="800" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ9Ap1-j9V4ypOsFRbqWGvBZCV2wJTDYa_9MD-XC7Nng045E_SvU7i4hePEMl9PpK2j4c17a3Qqo4ZG/pubembed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>
</div>
<p>As part of Peiying Primary School’s continued commitment to promoting
Chinese language learning, our students participated in the Cultural Performance
Exposure Scheme (CPES) 2025. This initiative, supported by the Committee
to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), aims to enhance students’
appreciation of the Chinese language through exposure to local cultural
performances.</p>
<p>This year, students attended a Chinese drama performance titled <em>“Journey to the West – Thrice Borrowing the Plantain Fan” 《三借芭蕉扇》</em>,
staged by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Cultural Academy. The performance,
adapted from one of the classic episodes of the renowned Chinese literary
work <em>Journey to the West</em>, offered students a unique opportunity
to experience the richness of traditional Chinese storytelling and stagecraft.</p>
<p>Through this exposure, students deepened their appreciation for the Chinese
language and culture. By witnessing the expressive use of language, characterisation,
and cultural nuances in a live performance, students were able to connect
their classroom learning with real-world cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Peiying Primary School remains committed to nurturing bilingual and bicultural
learners.</p>
<h4>60th National Day</h4>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe height="500" width="800" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQIakqhP67qUVx4sYoikuyJz6WsIEZkCjbZHAfMOldLMHFm40AddL9-eumERgm00rTNMzGnwQ1NT3Mv/pubembed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>
</div>
<p>On 9 August 2025, Singapore celebrated our 60th National Day. This year’s
theme, <em>“Majulah Singapura”</em> (Onward Singapore), echoed the title
of our national anthem and served as both a reflection of our nation’s
journey and a call to move forward together with unity and purpose.</p>
<p>At Peiying Primary School, we commemorated this significant occasion through
a series of engaging recess activities and a meaningful National Day Celebration.</p>
<p>The celebration began with a ceremonial segment that included the raising
of the national flag, the singing of the national anthem, and the recitation
of the national pledge. These symbolic acts instilled a strong sense of
identity and unity among our students, reminding them of their role as
active citizens and their shared responsibility in shaping Singapore’s
future.</p>
<p>Following the ceremony, students were treated to spirited performances
by our Performing Arts groups, a National Day presentation, videos, and
a photo montage. These showcased key moments in Singapore’s history - from
the challenges of separation to the successes of today - encouraging students
to appreciate the resilience of our pioneers and the importance of continuing
Singapore’s story with courage and determination.</p>
<p>Through these activities, our students were reminded of the value of nationhood,
the strength of community, and the pride of being Singaporean. The celebration
served not only to honour our past but to inspire a collective vision for
the future. <em>Majulah Singapura</em>!</p>
<h4>Anti-Bullying Programme 2025 – ‘The Power of Kindness’</h4>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe height="500" width="800" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS--1NUJZvmoQ9w_bPcxnxxiHFAxVNi7bus9OW8f2OmkiH26tb7v5--8-woBGY-Ng15QMFbhqtEvWpg/pubembed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>
</div>
<p>As part of our continued commitment to student well-being, Peiying Primary
School launched this year’s Anti-Bullying Programme with the theme <strong>“The Power of Kindness.”</strong> This
initiative aims to nurture a culture of care and respect, where students
build strong, positive peer relationships and develop a clear understanding
of what constitutes unacceptable behaviours.</p>
<p>The programme highlights the importance of making responsible choices
and treating others with kindness and empathy. A series of activities were
carried out to reinforce the message, including Pre-assembly talks on “The
Power of Kindness”, assembly programme and recess activities. At its core,
it encourages students to become Upstanders, to actively stand up against
unacceptable behaviours and support their peers. Thus, fostering a safe
school environment.</p>
<p>A key focus of the initiative is also to strengthen our peer support culture.
Through their involvement, our Peer Buddy Leaders were empowered to take
on greater responsibilities, demonstrating leadership and promoting awareness
across the school. One such effort was the Anti-Bullying Book Display in
the school library, curated to engage students meaningfully in conversations
about kindness, empathy, and respect.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, our students were reminded of their shared
responsibility in creating a caring school community. Together, we continue
to empower every child to act with kindness, empathy, and courage.</p>
<h4>P5 Camp</h4>

<p>From 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> September, our Primary 5 students
embarked on an unforgettable adventure at the MOE Jalan Bahtera Outdoor
Adventure Learning Centre. Surrounded by nature, the 3-day camp offered
a meaningful opportunity for students to build friendships, develop resilience,
and create lasting memories.</p>
<p>Teamwork was at the heart of many activities, such as the Low Rope Elements,
where students learned the importance of communication, cooperation, and
supporting one another. Working towards shared goals helped them develop
empathy and a strong sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Students also took on exciting personal challenges, including the Rock-climbing
Wall and Challenge Rope Course. These high elements pushed them out of
their comfort zones, helping them overcome fears and grow in perseverance
and self-confidence. Activities like Abseiling and Zip-lining further strengthened
their courage and trust in their peers and safety equipment.</p>
<p>A nature hike at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve allowed students to appreciate
Singapore’s unique ecosystem and learn about the importance of mangroves,
deepening their connection with the environment.</p>
<p>The camp concluded with a heartwarming campfire session, where students
celebrated their achievements through engaging performances. In preparing
for the performances, they demonstrated leadership, teamwork, and strengthened
their friendships.</p>
<p>Our students returned to school with greater confidence, deeper connections,
and valuable life skills that will support them in future challenges -
both in and beyond the classroom.</p>
<h4>AEP Music Assembly – Strings Quartet</h4>
<p>Peiying Primary School is excited to present our 2025 Music Assembly,
part of the Art Education Programme. This year’s focus is on the magical
world of string instruments - the violin, viola, and cello.</p>
<p>Through fun and engaging performances, students experienced the unique
sounds and styles of each instrument. From the soaring melodies of the
violin to the rich harmonies of the viola and the deep resonance of the
cello, the assembly opened our students’ ears to the beauty of string music.</p>
<p>More than just a performance, the assembly aimed to spark joy and inspire
a lasting love for music. By seeing and hearing these instruments up close,
we hope our students feel encouraged to explore their own musical interests.</p>

education that nurtures creativity and passion in every child.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2025, our school commemorated Racial Harmony Day with the
theme "Our People, Our Tapestry", a celebration of Singapore’s multicultural
identity and the rich traditions that unite us as one nation. The highlight
of the celebration was a vibrant Assembly Programme, where students were
treated to an engaging presentation highlighting the importance of racial
harmony and our shared heritage. A colourful Fashion Parade followed, featuring
students and teachers proudly showcasing traditional ethnic attire - a
lively expression of the diversity that binds us together as a community.</p>
<p>The day was filled with meaningful activities that deepened students’
appreciation for cultural diversity. During recess, students explored various
traditions through hands-on cultural experiences supported by our dedicated
Parent Support Group (PSG). These included thoranam (Indian decorative
garlands), ketupat weaving (a traditional Malay craft), rangoli art, colouring
the wau (traditional Malay kite), and decorating Chinese dumpling forms.
Together with student reflections, contributions from the PSG and students
culminated in a stunning Harmony Garden visual display - a creative tribute
to the spirit of unity in diversity.</p>

while we come from diverse backgrounds, we are all threads of the same
tapestry — stronger and more beautiful together.</p>

awareness about eco-friendly practices, and encouraging community support

drew enthusiastic responses from children and adults alike. The interactive
nature of these exhibits allowed the community to experience the joy of
play while learning about the importance of reusing materials.</p>

P.L.A.Y. Day – <em>Peiying Learn And PlaY Day</em>. This special day is
part of our continued efforts to nurture the joy of learning in our students

learning does not just happen in the classroom – it also happens when children
explore, play, reflect and work with one another.</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 students visited Qian Hu Fish Farm where they learned about
the different types of fish, sustainable practices used at farms and awareness
of the impact of human activities on aquatic life. Primary 2 students went
on a fun and educational trip to River Wonders, discovering more about
animals and learning more about different river habitats.</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 to 5 students, took part in Values in Action (VIA) activities.

rooted learners, the Primary 3 Mother Tongue Language (MTL) &amp; Cultural
Day Camp was held on 4 July 2025. The camp gave students a meaningful and

and cultures. In line with the school’s vision of developing key life skills
in our students, the camp also emphasised communication and teamwork through
engaging, practical activities.</p>
<p>With the theme <strong>“Engage and Embrace MTL and Culture!”</strong>,

These experiences helped students see the connection between language and
culture in everyday life.</p>

<p>Our Primary 5 students embarked on an enriching three-day learning journey
to Penang, Malaysia, immersing themselves in the vibrant tapestry of local
culture and heritage. Through visits to historical sites like the UNESCO-listed
George Town, the magnificent Blue Mansion, and the fascinating Peranakan
Museum, students gained profound insights into Penang's rich multicultural
heritage.</p>
<p>A highlight was their visit to Entopia Park, where many students had their
first thrilling encounter with diverse insects and small reptiles like
geckos in their natural habitats, fostering a deeper appreciation for wildlife
conservation and animal adaptations.</p>
<p>Demonstrating resilience and independence, they also participated in traditional
craft workshops, creating their own wayang kulit puppets and learning the
intricate art of bead-stringing to make star-shaped keychains, while discovering
the cultural significance of beadwork in Penang's history.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of their journey was the school immersion experience at PIBK
SJKC Perempuan China, where students displayed exemplary PRIDE values whilst
engaging with their Penang peers in activities ranging from handicraft
sessions to collaborative pizza-making. Their growth mindset was evident
as they embraced new experiences, overcame challenges, and forged meaningful
cross-cultural friendships.</p>
<p>These shared experiences not only broadened their global perspectives
but also developed their character and independence, creating lasting bonds
with their newfound friends across the border.</p>

</div>
<p>P.L.A.Y. Day on 15 April was a blast!</p>
<p>Our students had an exciting time learning beyond the classroom, where
each level explored unique programmes that build knowledge, skills, and
values.</p>
<p>As part of our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), our Primary 1 students
visited the Singapore Zoo. They get up close with wildlife whilst learning
about conservation and environmental awareness.</p>
<p>Primary 2 students explored Gardens by the Bay, guided by our very own
teachers! They learned how plants adapt to different conditions and the
importance of preserving nature. It was an eye-opening experience that
brought science to life in the real world.</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 to 6 students took part in two exciting programmes:</p>
<p>In the Growth Mindset Programme, students had a great time trying to solve
the Rubik’s Cube. With each twist and turn, they practised resilience and
reminded themselves that “Everyone can learn and they just haven’t learnt
it yet!” This hands-on challenge helped them embrace mistakes and grow
their problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Student Leadership Programme empowered our students to
become confident, empathetic, and effective leaders through team-based
activities and thoughtful reflection.</p>
<p>These experiences showed our students that learning happens everywhere
– from nature walks to puzzle-solving. Most importantly, they learned that
with the right mindset, growth is always possible.</p>

</div>
<p>International Friendship Day (IFD) was commemorated on 17 April 2025.
The theme for International Friendship Day (IFD) 2025 is “Forging Friendships
in A Complex World”. For this year’s IFD Commemoration, the Character and
Citizenship Education (CCE) department put together an assembly programme
and a series of activities for both CCE-FTGP lessons as well as recess
activities to emphasise the importance of our country's role in the region
and fostering strong bonds with our neighbours.</p>
<p>During our school assembly, students learnt about ASEAN countries, with
a special focus on Malaysia, the 2025 ASEAN Chair. Students learnt more
about the culture in Malaysia, language, food, and people. A specially
prepared video featuring our students from the ASEAN countries also helped
to connect us across borders. The assembly ended on a vibrant note with
a performance of a traditional Malaysian dance.</p>
<p>Recess activities were carried out to complement the learning from the
assembly programme. Students gained knowledge about the flags and currencies
of the ASEAN countries. Through answering quizzes, students were actively
engaged in showing their understanding of International Friendship Day.
They also wrote well wishes to their friends from ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>We hope that these learning experiences will reinforce the understanding
of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond.</p>

<p>The celebration was a resounding success, deepening cultural awareness
and strengthening bonds within our diverse school community. It was heartwarming

represents.</p>

Ambassadors. Additionally, teachers engaged students through storytelling
sessions in their classrooms, while encouraging a love for reading. On

their creativity by dressing up as individuals in various professions.
Through engaging activities and creative expression, we're helping our
students discover the diverse world of careers while building essential
language skills.</p>
<p>Level-specific activities were also designed to enhance the students'
language learning experience during the EL Fiesta, such as Choral Reading

</div>
<p>On 13 February 2025, our school commemorated Total Defence Day. 15 February
is a day etched in our hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation
during challenging times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during
World War II.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, students and staff experienced a water disruption
simulation. All the water points in the canteen and Staff Room were cordoned
off during the recess periods. Students and staff had to find other sources
of water in another location in the school. It was a tangible reminder
of our vulnerability, given Singapore's dependence on water supply and
the potential disruptions it could entail. This exercise also helped our
students develop the resilience and adaptability needed to cope with such
real-world challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights. It's not just about experiencing the
simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity and resilience within
our school community, echoing the spirit of Total Defence that has sustained
our nation.</p>

<p>In January, Peiying Primary School celebrated the joy of friendship—both
old and new! With the theme <em>“Everyone Can Learn to Be a Friend,”</em> the
exciting week tied in with the school’s peer support message, <em>“Every Peiying Student is a Buddy”.</em>
</p>
<p>The Friendship Week kicked off with lively pre-assembly talks and class
activities led by Form Teachers. Through fun role-plays and discussions,
students picked up useful skills on being upstanders and peacemakers, learning
how to step up when a friend needs help. Each level explored different
friendship themes:</p>
<p><strong>Primary 1 &amp; 2</strong> – <em>How to Make Friends</em>
<br><strong>Primary 3 &amp; 4</strong> – <em>How to Help My Friends</em>
<br><strong>Primary 5 &amp; 6</strong> – <em>How to Be Peacemakers and Help Friends Manage Conflicts</em>
</p>
<p>Throughout the week, the school was buzzing with friendship-filled activities!
In the canteen, students had a blast at the <strong>Bingo Game Booth</strong>,
where they searched for friends who matched descriptions on their Bingo
Cards. At the <strong>Friendship Card Booth</strong>, they wrote notes of
appreciation to their friends. Over in the library, students were encouraged
to borrow books about friendship, discovering even more ways to be a great
friend!</p>
<p>The Friendship Week was a wonderful reminder of our Term 1 Growth Mindset

students were given the opportunity to do a choral reading presentation
to their cohort friends and parents in school. It was a great platform
to engage our students in reading together while also developing their
language skills, confidence, and teamwork.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parents of our Primary One students were also invited for our Read@Peiying
event. The English Department, in collaboration with the Mother Tongue
Department and School Library, provided resources and support for parents
to read with their child and enjoy story time together in the school. Some
of our parents were also dressed in their favourite book characters. Everyone
had a fantastic time reading with their parents!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to encourage parents to continue reading with your child!
Spark a love for reading by sharing stories with them regularly.</p>

serving the school community, the school held its annual Key Student Leaders’
Investiture for our Primary 3 to 6 Prefects and Junior Sports Leaders (JSLs)

<p></p>
<p>Our student leaders play a vital role in our school community and have

<h3>Total Defence Day</h3>
<p>On 15 February 2024, our school observed a significant milestone: the
40th anniversary of Total Defence in Singapore. It's a day etched in our
hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation during challenging
times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, both students and staff immersed themselves
in an energy disruption simulation. Imagine the hum of electricity fading
away as the clocks struck 8.00 am, plunging our school into temporary darkness
until 9.00 am. It was a tangible reminder of our vulnerability, given Singapore's
dependence on fuel imports and the potential disruptions it could entail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through this exercise, we aimed to equip our students with the readiness
to face such disruptions, where we would need to prioritise the allocation
of electricity for critical sectors. It was a glimpse into a possible future
where households, including our schools, might have to adapt to such challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights with their peers. It's not just about
experiencing the simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity
and resilience within our school community, echoing the spirit of Total
Defence that has sustained our nation for four decades.</p>

<h3>Chinese New Year Celebration</h3>
<p>Peiying welcomed the Year of the Dragon with a blast this year with an
exciting lineup of Chinese New Year activities for the students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students were engaged in interesting classroom activities at the start
of the day. The mass dance involvement by the whole school also added much
vibrancy to the occasion. Another highlight for this year’s CNY celebrations
included Wushu and Dance performances by our very own Peiying talents!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We ended the school celebrations on a high note, with the arrival of both
the Dragon and Lion Dance troupes. Students were exhilarated to see them
in our school hall!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s wishing everyone a joyous and smooth Dragon year ahead!</p>

<h3>Cyber-wellness Week</h3>
<p>The Student Management Department orchestrated a dynamic Cyber Wellness
Week from 5 February to 8 February, bursting with engaging activities.
This year's theme is on fostering responsible digital habits and managing
screen time. With a spotlight on the detrimental effects of excessive screen
exposure on mental and physical well-being, particularly among our youth,
the event aimed to ignite awareness and spark action for Cyber Wellness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From captivating assembly talks to vibrant Cyber Wellness information
board displays stationed in the library, students were immersed in an interactive
journey to learn about Cyber Wellness. Quizzes challenged their knowledge,
while reflective sessions prompted deep introspection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ultimate goal? To empower our students to navigate the digital landscape
with confidence and discernment, making choices that prioritise their well-being.</p>

<h3>First Day of School</h3>
<p>Embarking on a new journey with excitement and smiles! Our P1 students
kicked off their first day at school with a mix of emotions. Waving goodbyes
to their parents at the school hall, they walked to their classrooms under
the care of their Form Teachers and engaged in fun activities with their
teachers and friends in the classrooms. The P1 students swiftly embraced
the primary school experience and settled into the new environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They were happy to have their first recess with their parents and were
eager to explore the food options in the school canteen. A day brimming
with smiles and fresh beginnings! Before they knew it, the school bell
signaled the end of the day. Our P1 students looked forward to reuniting
with their families, with some anticipating their very first school bus
ride or immersing themselves in the student care experience. Wishing all
our P1 students the best on this exciting journey ahead!</p>
