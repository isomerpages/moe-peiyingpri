### **Events and Programmes**
#### **NE Show 2022**
On 2nd July 2022, 180 Primary 5 students and 12 staff attended the National Education (NE) Show which was a preview of National Day Parade 2022. This year, the NE Show was held at The Float @ Marina Bay with Singapore’s city skyline as its magnificent backdrop. The theme for this year’s NDP is “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**”

The theme, “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**” is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as strong, united people towards a better future. “Stronger Together” also reminds us that our unity in diversity is what makes us stronger.

Our students viewed a showcase of Singapore’s defence capabilities and enjoyed the Singapore Story depicted by a colourful display of sights and sounds. For many students, it was their first time watching the NDP at the venue itself. The NE Show had certainly evoked a sense of patriotism amongst our students and imparted the significance of our National Day Parade to them.

#### **P4 Cultural Experience**

With relaxed safe management measures, the much-awaited P4 Cultural Experience took place on 13 July 2022.

Our Primary 4 students went for an eye-opening cultural experience to Kampung Glam. The purpose of the programme is to provide the experience for our students to appreciate the diversity of cultures and heritage in Singapore.&nbsp;

Our students learnt to identify spices used in local recipes, went on a walking trail around Kampung Glam and tried their hands at batik painting at the Aliwal Arts Centre. Everyone was amazed with the art pieces done by our students. We never knew we had so many budding artists! It was also a good opportunity for bonding among schoolmates and they got to develop character values and life skills.

 #### **Earth Month 2022**

Peiying Primary School commemorates Earth Day annually with a myriad of eco-friendly activities to emphasise the importance of environmental sustainability and eco-stewardship.

Students were given opportunities to champion environmentally friendly causes and one signature event is the Annual Upcycling Competition. This year, we received a record number of upcycled artefacts! This is a testament of how we can extend the life of existing resources instead of wasting them. With our creativity, we can even come up with unique and interesting masterpieces! We hope to be an inspiration to others to practice upcycling in their daily lives.

We also touched on focus topics such as the Energy Crisis we are facing, on top of Global Warming and Climate Change. For an authentic and impactful learning experience, we had a ‘10-minute electricity-free’ moment where all classes turned off the lights and fans. This taught students to appreciate the comfort and convenience electricity has been bringing us, and to be responsible users so that there would still be electricity for generations to come!

This year, we also had a school-community collaboration with Nee Soon South CC. Our school initiated a mini upcycled Origami Trash Bin project. All staff, students, parents and members of the Parents-Support-Group folded more than 4,500 pieces of origami trash bins made from used paper.&nbsp;

The Grassroot Advisor for Nee Soon South, Ms Carrie Tan, as well as four other grassroot leaders, visited our school on 4 May 2022 to join and support us in our community outreach efforts. Together with a class of students, they had a fun time folding origami trash bins!

These origami trash bins will soon be distributed at the food centres in Nee Soon South. We hope to kickstart a ‘Bring-Your-Own-Bin’ movement within our community where members of the public embrace the joy of ‘a simple act of upcycling’ that can also keep our dining spaces clean for the comfort of everyone!

#### **International Friendship Day 2022**
Peiying Primary School commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on 4th April 2022.The Chair for 2022 is Cambodia, so an emphasis was placed on the customs and traditions of the country.&nbsp; Not all the ten ASEAN countries were showcased due to time constraints. The PowerPoint presentation for the Assembly Period focused on Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar because of the similarities these countries shared with Singapore like the New Year and Dragon boat festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The theme for IFD 2022 was Singapore in Asia. There was information given about Singapore’s contribution to ASEAN countries during times of natural disasters and emergencies. The slides showed Singapore sending our soldiers, doctors, civil defence personnel, equipment, vaccines and financial aid to Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos and the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

For the CCE-FTGP lesson, the Primary One level did an activity to help them recognise the flags of the ASEAN countries. The Primary Two level learned greetings in different ASEAN country languages. The Primary Three level learned about the national flowers of the ASEAN countries. The Primary 4 to 6 countries had discussions on how ASEAN countries can help each other, how working as a cohesive community is beneficial and what commonalities ASEAN countries shared.&nbsp;

It was heartening to hear from various form teachers how the students recognised many of the flags and had meaningful conversations about how ASEAN countries need each other’s help in times of difficulties.

#### **Let’s Celebrate English with a Touch of Magic**
The annual English Language Fiesta was held on 28 March 2022 to 22 April 2022. It was organised by the English Department to encourage our students to speak good English, to be avid readers and to infuse creativity in their writing. This year’s theme was ‘Let’s Celebrate English with a Touch of Magic’. The students celebrated the English Language ‘with a touch of magic’ by participating in class activities like Readers’ Theatre, Poetry and Creative Writing. Guest readers were invited to share interesting stories held at the school library. The students also experienced ‘A Blind Date with a Book’.&nbsp;

On 1 April 2022, the staff and students were dressed up to the theme of ‘Magic and Enchantment’ and the school was filled with magical characters like fairies, wizards and witches. Our students were taken on a trip to their favourite magical wonderland where many book characters came alive in the school compound. These included storybook characters like Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and even Prince Charming. Instantly, Peiying Primary School was transformed into a land of magic!&nbsp; It was indeed a memorable event for the school.

#### **Friendship Week**
We commemorated Friendship Week on the first week of Term 2 (21 March 2022 - 1 April 2022). The theme for this year’s Friendship Week is Sustaining Friendships. The planned activities were a combined effort of the Art, MRL and CCE Departments. The activities aimed to strengthen peer support relationships among students.

It was a great opportunity for the students to show appreciation for their peers, and to foster stronger and more positive friendships. We started the week with an E-assembly talk. Primary 1 to Primary 3 students watched a skit - “We Can All Be Friends”, while Primary 4 to Primary 6 students learnt about “accepting our friends and their differences”.&nbsp;

Next, the students proceeded to make friendship bookmarks for their buddies in class. The students expressed their gratitude towards their buddies and exchanged their token of appreciation with one another. During recess, students also had the chance to explore books that were “friendship” themed! We hope that this Friendship Week would reinforce the importance of positive relationships built on trust, empathy and respect for one another.

#### **Peer Support Relationship in CCA**
Peer Support Relationships (PSR) initiative builds on our school's culture of care. It aims to create a supportive and caring environment so that our students would feel safe, accepted and empowered. All Peiying students were taught to be kind and caring, to identify their social circle of support, and recognise signs of distress between peers through our various PSR activities.&nbsp; This year, we extended the PSR activities to our CCAs. Through PSR in CCA, the students bonded with one another, and this strengthened their relationship with their fellow CCA members. They also learnt important skills like teamwork and communication as they participated in the games. At the end of the activities, they each chose a buddy and spent some time to get to know their buddy better.&nbsp; This PSR initiative has shown students that they are able to provide social and emotional support for one another, and it strongly resonates with our school’s belief that no child should be left behind.

#### **P3 and P4 Enrichment Programme**
With the aim of promoting oracy among students, the English department conducted several enrichment workshops for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students.  

Primary 3 students were engaged in Readers’ Theatre, which helped them to learn to express themselves appropriately, confidently, clearly, eloquently and expressively. They were also taught a variety of vocal techniques to present their stories.  

Primary 4 students had the opportunity to do Public Speaking, which helped them to learn the right public speaking skills in order to become an empathetic and effective communicator. The workshop also helped them gain confidence and motivation in delivering a narrative through positive reinforcement.
