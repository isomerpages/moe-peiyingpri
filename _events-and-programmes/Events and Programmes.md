<p>Our Primary 5 students embarked on an enriching three-day learning journey
to Penang, Malaysia, immersing themselves in the vibrant tapestry of local
culture and heritage. Through visits to historical sites like the UNESCO-listed
George Town, the magnificent Blue Mansion, and the fascinating Peranakan
Museum, students gained profound insights into Penang's rich multicultural
heritage.</p>
<p>A highlight was their visit to Entopia Park, where many students had their
first thrilling encounter with diverse insects and small reptiles like
geckos in their natural habitats, fostering a deeper appreciation for wildlife
conservation and animal adaptations.</p>
<p>Demonstrating resilience and independence, they also participated in traditional
craft workshops, creating their own wayang kulit puppets and learning the
intricate art of bead-stringing to make star-shaped keychains, while discovering
the cultural significance of beadwork in Penang's history.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of their journey was the school immersion experience at PIBK
SJKC Perempuan China, where students displayed exemplary PRIDE values whilst
engaging with their Penang peers in activities ranging from handicraft
sessions to collaborative pizza-making. Their growth mindset was evident
as they embraced new experiences, overcame challenges, and forged meaningful
cross-cultural friendships.</p>
<p>These shared experiences not only broadened their global perspectives
but also developed their character and independence, creating lasting bonds
with their newfound friends across the border.</p>

</div>
<p>P.L.A.Y. Day on 15 April was a blast!</p>
<p>Our students had an exciting time learning beyond the classroom, where
each level explored unique programmes that build knowledge, skills, and
values.</p>
<p>As part of our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), our Primary 1 students
visited the Singapore Zoo. They get up close with wildlife whilst learning
about conservation and environmental awareness.</p>
<p>Primary 2 students explored Gardens by the Bay, guided by our very own
teachers! They learned how plants adapt to different conditions and the
importance of preserving nature. It was an eye-opening experience that
brought science to life in the real world.</p>
<p>Our Primary 3 to 6 students took part in two exciting programmes:</p>
<p>In the Growth Mindset Programme, students had a great time trying to solve
the Rubik’s Cube. With each twist and turn, they practised resilience and
reminded themselves that “Everyone can learn and they just haven’t learnt
it yet!” This hands-on challenge helped them embrace mistakes and grow
their problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Student Leadership Programme empowered our students to
become confident, empathetic, and effective leaders through team-based
activities and thoughtful reflection.</p>
<p>These experiences showed our students that learning happens everywhere
– from nature walks to puzzle-solving. Most importantly, they learned that
with the right mindset, growth is always possible.</p>

<h4>International Friendship Day (IFD)</h4>
<div class="iframe-wrapper">
<iframe height="500" width="800" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQi-z5kB1MpFAosgeB4Zw2HBOieKfnD_zLhQzPclUAvKjtMq2szKmugeh26QvsffJNaB1F-l8jTe_Ci/pubembed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>
</div>
<p>International Friendship Day (IFD) was commemorated on 17 April 2025.
The theme for International Friendship Day (IFD) 2025 is “Forging Friendships
in A Complex World”. For this year’s IFD Commemoration, the Character and
Citizenship Education (CCE) department put together an assembly programme
and a series of activities for both CCE-FTGP lessons as well as recess
activities to emphasise the importance of our country's role in the region
and fostering strong bonds with our neighbours.</p>
<p>During our school assembly, students learnt about ASEAN countries, with
a special focus on Malaysia, the 2025 ASEAN Chair. Students learnt more
about the culture in Malaysia, language, food, and people. A specially
prepared video featuring our students from the ASEAN countries also helped
to connect us across borders. The assembly ended on a vibrant note with
a performance of a traditional Malaysian dance.</p>
<p>Recess activities were carried out to complement the learning from the
assembly programme. Students gained knowledge about the flags and currencies
of the ASEAN countries. Through answering quizzes, students were actively
engaged in showing their understanding of International Friendship Day.
They also wrote well wishes to their friends from ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>We hope that these learning experiences will reinforce the understanding
of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond.</p>

their creativity by dressing up as individuals in various professions.
Through engaging activities and creative expression, we're helping our
students discover the diverse world of careers while building essential
language skills.</p>
<p>Level-specific activities were also designed to enhance the students'
language learning experience during the EL Fiesta, such as Choral Reading

</div>
<p>On 13 February 2025, our school commemorated Total Defence Day. 15 February
is a day etched in our hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation
during challenging times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during
World War II.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, students and staff experienced a water disruption
simulation. All the water points in the canteen and Staff Room were cordoned
off during the recess periods. Students and staff had to find other sources
of water in another location in the school. It was a tangible reminder
of our vulnerability, given Singapore's dependence on water supply and
the potential disruptions it could entail. This exercise also helped our
students develop the resilience and adaptability needed to cope with such
real-world challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights. It's not just about experiencing the
simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity and resilience within
our school community, echoing the spirit of Total Defence that has sustained
our nation.</p>

<br><strong>Primary 3 &amp; 4</strong> – <em>How to Help My Friends</em>
<br><strong>Primary 5 &amp; 6</strong> – <em>How to Be Peacemakers and Help Friends Manage Conflicts</em>
</p>

In the canteen, students had a blast at the <strong>Bingo Game Booth</strong>,
where they searched for friends who matched descriptions on their Bingo
Cards. At the <strong>Friendship Card Booth</strong>, they wrote notes of
appreciation to their friends. Over in the library, students were encouraged
to borrow books about friendship, discovering even more ways to be a great
friend!</p>
<p>The Friendship Week was a wonderful reminder of our Term 1 Growth Mindset
theme, <em>“Everyone Can Learn,”</em> to be a good friend. Here at Peiying

<p>On 2 January 2025, Peiying Primary School warmly welcomed its new cohort
of Primary 1 students as they embarked on an exciting educational journey
with us. The day began with parents accompanying their children to their
respective classrooms, where students had the opportunity to meet their
teachers and new classmates. Engaging classroom activities were planned
to help students ease into their new environment and foster connections
with their peers.</p>
<p>While the students settled into their routines, parents attended an engagement
session with our Principal and Year Head. The parents were given insights
into the school’s holistic approach to education, the support systems,
and the importance of a strong school-home partnership.</p>
<p>A highlight of the day was the parent-child bonding during recess, where
parents joined their children in the school canteen. This shared experience
not only strengthened familial ties but also helped students adapt to the
school environment with greater confidence.</p>
<p>We at Peiying Primary School are dedicated to nurturing every child’s
growth and empowering them to become lifelong learners and confident leaders.

<h3>International Friendship Day (IFD)</h3>
<p>International Friendship Day (IFD) is commemorated on 18 April 2024. The

We learned that we can also play a part by making friends from ASEAN countries
and learning more about the countries. This year, the focus is on Laos
PDR who is the ASEAN Chairmanship 2024. Four of our CCE ambassadors shared
about the culture, language, food and people from Laos with a short skit
during the assembly programme.</p>

<h3>Total Defence Day</h3>
<p>On 15 February 2024, our school observed a significant milestone: the
40th anniversary of Total Defence in Singapore. It's a day etched in our
hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation during challenging
times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, both students and staff immersed themselves
in an energy disruption simulation. Imagine the hum of electricity fading
away as the clocks struck 8.00 am, plunging our school into temporary darkness
until 9.00 am. It was a tangible reminder of our vulnerability, given Singapore's
dependence on fuel imports and the potential disruptions it could entail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through this exercise, we aimed to equip our students with the readiness
to face such disruptions, where we would need to prioritise the allocation
of electricity for critical sectors. It was a glimpse into a possible future
where households, including our schools, might have to adapt to such challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights with their peers. It's not just about
experiencing the simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity
and resilience within our school community, echoing the spirit of Total
Defence that has sustained our nation for four decades.</p>

<h3>Cyber-wellness Week</h3>
<p>The Student Management Department orchestrated a dynamic Cyber Wellness
Week from 5 February to 8 February, bursting with engaging activities.
This year's theme is on fostering responsible digital habits and managing
screen time. With a spotlight on the detrimental effects of excessive screen
exposure on mental and physical well-being, particularly among our youth,
the event aimed to ignite awareness and spark action for Cyber Wellness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From captivating assembly talks to vibrant Cyber Wellness information
board displays stationed in the library, students were immersed in an interactive
journey to learn about Cyber Wellness. Quizzes challenged their knowledge,
while reflective sessions prompted deep introspection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ultimate goal? To empower our students to navigate the digital landscape
with confidence and discernment, making choices that prioritise their well-being.</p>

<h3>First Day of School</h3>
<p>Embarking on a new journey with excitement and smiles! Our P1 students
kicked off their first day at school with a mix of emotions. Waving goodbyes
to their parents at the school hall, they walked to their classrooms under
the care of their Form Teachers and engaged in fun activities with their
teachers and friends in the classrooms. The P1 students swiftly embraced
the primary school experience and settled into the new environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They were happy to have their first recess with their parents and were
eager to explore the food options in the school canteen. A day brimming
with smiles and fresh beginnings! Before they knew it, the school bell
signaled the end of the day. Our P1 students looked forward to reuniting
with their families, with some anticipating their very first school bus
ride or immersing themselves in the student care experience. Wishing all
our P1 students the best on this exciting journey ahead!</p>
