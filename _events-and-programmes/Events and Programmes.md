### **Events and Programmes**
#### **NE Show 2022**
On 2nd July 2022, 180 Primary 5 students and 12 staff attended the National Education (NE) Show which was a preview of National Day Parade 2022. This year, the NE Show was held at The Float @ Marina Bay with Singapore’s city skyline as its magnificent backdrop. The theme for this year’s NDP is “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**”

The theme, “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**” is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as strong, united people towards a better future. “Stronger Together” also reminds us that our unity in diversity is what makes us stronger.

Our students viewed a showcase of Singapore’s defence capabilities and enjoyed the Singapore Story depicted by a colourful display of sights and sounds. For many students, it was their first time watching the NDP at the venue itself. The NE Show had certainly evoked a sense of patriotism amongst our students and imparted the significance of our National Day Parade to them.

#### **P4 Cultural Experience**

With relaxed safe management measures, the much-awaited P4 Cultural Experience took place on 13 July 2022.

Our Primary 4 students went for an eye-opening cultural experience to Kampung Glam. The purpose of the programme is to provide the experience for our students to appreciate the diversity of cultures and heritage in Singapore.&nbsp;

Our students learnt to identify spices used in local recipes, went on a walking trail around Kampung Glam and tried their hands at batik painting at the Aliwal Arts Centre. Everyone was amazed with the art pieces done by our students. We never knew we had so many budding artists! It was also a good opportunity for bonding among schoolmates and they got to develop character values and life skills.

 #### **Earth Month 2022**

Peiying Primary School commemorates Earth Day annually with a myriad of eco-friendly activities to emphasise the importance of environmental sustainability and eco-stewardship.

Students were given opportunities to champion environmentally friendly causes and one signature event is the Annual Upcycling Competition. This year, we received a record number of upcycled artefacts! This is a testament of how we can extend the life of existing resources instead of wasting them. With our creativity, we can even come up with unique and interesting masterpieces! We hope to be an inspiration to others to practice upcycling in their daily lives.

We also touched on focus topics such as the Energy Crisis we are facing, on top of Global Warming and Climate Change. For an authentic and impactful learning experience, we had a ‘10-minute electricity-free’ moment where all classes turned off the lights and fans. This taught students to appreciate the comfort and convenience electricity has been bringing us, and to be responsible users so that there would still be electricity for generations to come!

This year, we also had a school-community collaboration with Nee Soon South CC. Our school initiated a mini upcycled Origami Trash Bin project. All staff, students, parents and members of the Parents-Support-Group folded more than 4,500 pieces of origami trash bins made from used paper.&nbsp;

The Grassroot Advisor for Nee Soon South, Ms Carrie Tan, as well as four other grassroot leaders, visited our school on 4 May 2022 to join and support us in our community outreach efforts. Together with a class of students, they had a fun time folding origami trash bins!

These origami trash bins will soon be distributed at the food centres in Nee Soon South. We hope to kickstart a ‘Bring-Your-Own-Bin’ movement within our community where members of the public embrace the joy of ‘a simple act of upcycling’ that can also keep our dining spaces clean for the comfort of everyone!
