<h3><strong>Events and Programmes</strong></h3>
<h3>Primary 5 Cohort Camp Experience</h3>
<p>From 11 to 13 July, our Primary 5 students went on an unforgettable journey
of learning and fun at the cohort camp. Nestled in lush greenery and offering
many exciting activities, the camp at MOE Jalan Bahtera Outdoor Adventure
Learning Centre gave students the chance to step out of their comfort zones,
build strong bonds with friends, and create lasting memories of their primary
school life.</p>
<p><strong><u>Exploring Nature: Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The students went on a hiking trail at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. This
experience encouraged them to observe closely and appreciate the wetland
ecosystem in Singapore. Through this hike, the students learned about the
importance of mangroves and felt a deeper connection with nature.</p>
<p><strong><u>Building Resilience: High and Low Element Activities</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Throughout the camp, the students built resilience by overcoming challenges
in activities such as abseiling and zip-lining. Descending from the tall
structures, pupils tested their courage and learned to trust their peers,
instructors and equipment. These activities taught them resilience and
the importance of pushing through difficulties.</p>
<p><strong><u>Perseverance and Grit: Rock Climbing and Challenge Rope Course</u></strong>
</p>
<p>During rock climbing and the challenge rope course, the students learned
about perseverance and grit as they faced their fear of heights. They discovered
their inner strength and ability to build their physical and mental toughness,
fostering a positive self-image. The experience also taught them diligence,
as they had to focus and put in sustained effort to succeed.</p>
<p><strong><u>Teamwork and Collaboration: Low Rope Elements</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Teamwork was evident through collaborative activities and team-building
games like the low rope elements. Students learned the importance of cooperation,
communication, and supporting one another. They developed a sense of responsibility
towards their team and a willingness to contribute their best. Working
together towards common goals fostered empathy and respect for others,
with students learning to appreciate different perspectives and value their
peers' contributions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Leadership Development: Taking the Lead</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The camp gave students many opportunities to step up and take on leadership
roles. Whether it was motivating their team during problem-solving challenges,
leading performances during the campfire finale, or simply offering encouragement
to peers, students showcased their potential in developing leadership skills.
They learned to be leaders of character – to lead with integrity, demonstrating
honesty and strong moral principles in their actions.</p>
<p>The camp was indeed an enriching experience for our Primary 5 students.
They returned to school with a renewed sense of confidence, resilience,
and teamwork, ready to apply their newfound skills and school values to
other aspects of their lives.</p>

<h3>International Friendship Day (IFD)</h3>
<p>International Friendship Day (IFD) is commemorated on 18 April 2024. The
theme for International Friendship Day(IFD) 2024 is “Singapore In Asia”.
For this year’s IFD Commemoration, the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) committee put together an assembly programme and a series of activities
for both CCE-FTGP lessons as well as recess activities to emphasise the
importance of our country's role in the region and fostering strong bonds
with our neighbours.</p>
<p>Through the assembly programme, we learnt more about countries from ASEAN.
We learned that we can also play a part by making friends from ASEAN countries
and learning more about the countries. This year, the focus is on Laos
PDR who is the ASEAN Chairmanship 2024. Four of our CCE ambassadors shared
about the culture, language, food and people from Laos with a short skit
during the assembly programme.</p>
<p>Recess activities were carried out to complement the learning from the
assembly programme. Students gained knowledge about the flags from ASEAN
countries, identified the currencies used by ASEAN countries. Through answering
quizzes, students were able to reaffirm their understanding of International
Friendship Day.</p>
<p>We hope that these learning experiences will reinforce the understanding
of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond.</p>

<h3>P3 Kompang Performance</h3>
<p>Our primary 3 students embarked on an enriching journey of cultural exploration
by learning and performing with the kompang, a traditional Malay percussion
instrument. The rhythmic beats and lively sounds of the kompang introduced
the students to the rich musical heritage of the Malay culture, enhancing
their musical skills and appreciation for diverse cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Through rehearsals, students developed confidence, teamwork, and a sense
of pride in their abilities. Each rehearsal required attentive listening,
precise synchronization, and mutual support, which significantly improved
their coordination. The spirited performances provided an opportunity for
students to showcase their newfound talents to their peers and teachers.</p>
<p>Incorporating the vibrant sounds of the kompang into their educational
experience, our Primary 3 students not only enriched their musical abilities
but also embraced the beauty and diversity of cultural traditions. This
experience helped them cultivate a broader understanding and appreciation
of the world around them.</p>

<h3>Total Defence Day</h3>
<p>On 15 February 2024, our school observed a significant milestone: the
40th anniversary of Total Defence in Singapore. It's a day etched in our
hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation during challenging
times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, both students and staff immersed themselves
in an energy disruption simulation. Imagine the hum of electricity fading
away as the clocks struck 8.00 am, plunging our school into temporary darkness
until 9.00 am. It was a tangible reminder of our vulnerability, given Singapore's
dependence on fuel imports and the potential disruptions it could entail.</p>
<p>Through this exercise, we aimed to equip our students with the readiness
to face such disruptions, where we would need to prioritise the allocation
of electricity for critical sectors. It was a glimpse into a possible future
where households, including our schools, might have to adapt to such challenges.</p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights with their peers. It's not just about
experiencing the simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity
and resilience within our school community, echoing the spirit of Total
Defence that has sustained our nation for four decades.</p>

vibrancy to the occasion. Another highlight for this year’s CNY celebrations

the Dragon and Lion Dance troupes. Students were exhilarated to see them
in our school hall!</p>
<p>Here’s wishing everyone a joyous and smooth Dragon year ahead!</p>

<h3>Cyber-wellness Week</h3>
<p>The Student Management Department orchestrated a dynamic Cyber Wellness
Week from 5 February to 8 February, bursting with engaging activities.
This year's theme is on fostering responsible digital habits and managing
screen time. With a spotlight on the detrimental effects of excessive screen
exposure on mental and physical well-being, particularly among our youth,
the event aimed to ignite awareness and spark action for Cyber Wellness.</p>
<p>From captivating assembly talks to vibrant Cyber Wellness information
board displays stationed in the library, students were immersed in an interactive
journey to learn about Cyber Wellness. Quizzes challenged their knowledge,
while reflective sessions prompted deep introspection.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal? To empower our students to navigate the digital landscape
with confidence and discernment, making choices that prioritise their well-being.</p>

<p>We celebrated Teachers’ and Staff Day on 31 August. The theme for this
year’s celebration is “You Have Superpowers”! We acknowledge that every
staff in the school has their unique strengths and extraordinary abilities
in nurturing our students and creating a conducive school environment for
the students to develop into motivated and appreciative lifelong learners.
The whole school gathered and celebrated together in the hall. Performance
items were put up by our students and Parents Support Group to show their
appreciation to staff. The highlight of the day was the walk-in segment,
where students cheered loudly when their teachers entered the hall holding
the bouquet of flowers made by them!</p>
<p>It was an enjoyable event and a fitting end to the term.</p>
