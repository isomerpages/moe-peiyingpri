<h3>Celebrating Racial Harmony Day at Peiying Primary School</h3>
<p>At Peiying Primary School, Racial Harmony Day is a cherished occasion
that emphasizes unity and diversity. This year’s celebrations were a testament
to our vibrant multicultural community.</p>
<p>Leading up to Racial Harmony Day, our school organized engaging activities

activity, where students explored a multicultural theme through art, supported
by our dedicated Parents Support Group. This initiative not only encouraged
creative expression but also deepened students’ appreciation for our diverse
cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The assembly program served as the centerpiece of our celebration, featuring
a thought-provoking address on the importance of racial harmony. Highlighting
the event was a captivating fashion parade by our teachers and pupils showcasing
traditional attire from various cultures, symbolizing our collective pride
in our differences and unity in diversity.</p>

different cultures, fostering friendships and cultural exchange.</p>

<h3>International Friendship Day (IFD)</h3>
<p>International Friendship Day (IFD) is commemorated on 18 April 2024. The
theme for International Friendship Day(IFD) 2024 is “Singapore In Asia”.
For this year’s IFD Commemoration, the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) committee put together an assembly programme and a series of activities
for both CCE-FTGP lessons as well as recess activities to emphasise the
importance of our country's role in the region and fostering strong bonds
with our neighbours.</p>
<p>Through the assembly programme, we learnt more about countries from ASEAN.
We learned that we can also play a part by making friends from ASEAN countries
and learning more about the countries. This year, the focus is on Laos
PDR who is the ASEAN Chairmanship 2024. Four of our CCE ambassadors shared
about the culture, language, food and people from Laos with a short skit
during the assembly programme.</p>
<p>Recess activities were carried out to complement the learning from the
assembly programme. Students gained knowledge about the flags from ASEAN
countries, identified the currencies used by ASEAN countries. Through answering
quizzes, students were able to reaffirm their understanding of International
Friendship Day.</p>
<p>We hope that these learning experiences will reinforce the understanding
of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and beyond.</p>

<h3>P3 Kompang Performance</h3>
<p>Our primary 3 students embarked on an enriching journey of cultural exploration
by learning and performing with the kompang, a traditional Malay percussion
instrument. The rhythmic beats and lively sounds of the kompang introduced
the students to the rich musical heritage of the Malay culture, enhancing
their musical skills and appreciation for diverse cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Through rehearsals, students developed confidence, teamwork, and a sense
of pride in their abilities. Each rehearsal required attentive listening,
precise synchronization, and mutual support, which significantly improved
their coordination. The spirited performances provided an opportunity for
students to showcase their newfound talents to their peers and teachers.</p>
<p>Incorporating the vibrant sounds of the kompang into their educational
experience, our Primary 3 students not only enriched their musical abilities
but also embraced the beauty and diversity of cultural traditions. This
experience helped them cultivate a broader understanding and appreciation
of the world around them.</p>

<h4>Total Defence Day</h4>
<p>On 15 February 2024, our school observed a significant milestone: the
40th anniversary of Total Defence in Singapore. It's a day etched in our
hearts, reminding us of the resilience of our nation during challenging
times when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II.</p>
<p>As part of the commemoration, both students and staff immersed themselves
in an energy disruption simulation. Imagine the hum of electricity fading
away as the clocks struck 8.00 am, plunging our school into temporary darkness
until 9.00 am. It was a tangible reminder of our vulnerability, given Singapore's
dependence on fuel imports and the potential disruptions it could entail.</p>
<p>Through this exercise, we aimed to equip our students with the readiness
to face such disruptions, where we would need to prioritise the allocation
of electricity for critical sectors. It was a glimpse into a possible future
where households, including our schools, might have to adapt to such challenges.</p>
<p>After the simulation, our students engaged in reflective discussions,
sharing their emotions and insights with their peers. It's not just about
experiencing the simulation; it's about fostering a sense of solidarity
and resilience within our school community, echoing the spirit of Total
Defence that has sustained our nation for four decades.</p>

<h4>Chinese New Year Celebration</h4>

exciting lineup of Chinese New Year activities for the students.</p>

of the day. The mass dance involvement by the whole school also added much
vibrancy to the occasion. Another highlight for this year’s CNY celebrations
included Wushu and Dance performances by our very own Peiying talents!</p>
<p>We ended the school celebrations on a high note, with the arrival of both
the Dragon and Lion Dance troupes. Students were exhilarated to see them
in our school hall!</p>
<p>Here’s wishing everyone a joyous and smooth Dragon year ahead!</p>

<h4>Cyber-wellness Week</h4>
<p>The Student Management Department orchestrated a dynamic Cyber Wellness
Week from 5 February to 8 February, bursting with engaging activities.
This year's theme is on fostering responsible digital habits and managing
screen time. With a spotlight on the detrimental effects of excessive screen
exposure on mental and physical well-being, particularly among our youth,
the event aimed to ignite awareness and spark action for Cyber Wellness.</p>
<p>From captivating assembly talks to vibrant Cyber Wellness information
board displays stationed in the library, students were immersed in an interactive
journey to learn about Cyber Wellness. Quizzes challenged their knowledge,
while reflective sessions prompted deep introspection.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal? To empower our students to navigate the digital landscape
with confidence and discernment, making choices that prioritise their well-being.</p>

classroom discussions and assembly programme, students were introduced
to different cultural motifs and their meanings during recess activities.
With the great support of our school’s Parent Support Group members and
our very own CCE ambassadors, students were guided to colour the motifs
to form collages, which aptly ties in with this year’s theme, “Our Multicultural
Mosaic”.</p>

<h4>English Language Fiesta</h4>
<p>The English Language department had organised the English Language (EL)
Fiesta from 30 March to 28 April 2023 to encourage students to read widely
and be confident speakers. An array of events and activities were curated
for the different levels, as well as those for the whole school. This year,
the school had invited Mdm Cheng Puay Koon, our School Advisory Committee
member and illustrator of a P2 STELLAR unit ‘Roti Prata’ to read and draw
with the P2 students. In addition, the school invited students and staff
to come to school dressed in the theme of ‘Superheroes’ on 31 March 2023.
It was heartening to see the students dressed in characters such as princes,
princesses and superheroes from the storybooks they like.
<br>
<br>To further encourage the love of reading, some of our students from P3
to P6 were invited to share their favourite stories during the Pre-Assembly
periods. This activity had certainly captivated the students as they listened
to the storybook reviews and excerpts of stories. The promotion of a reading
culture is one of the cornerstones of the school and the EL Fiesta brings
about the joy of reading through the activities designed for the students.</p>

<h4>P5 Camp</h4>
<p>Our Primary 5 students attended the Outdoor Adventure Camp from 13-15
February 2023. The 3 days 2 nights camp was held at the MOE Dairy Farm
Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. Led by MOE’s Outdoor Adventure Educators
(OAEs) and teachers, our students had the opportunity to experience learning
through a variety of activities. These include the challenge rope course,
team building activities, stream exploration and many more! The highlight
of the camp was definitely the night walk, whereby students trekked through
Dairy Farm Nature Park with just the moonlight illuminating the way.</p>
<p>Through this camp, our students were actively engaged cognitively, physically
and affectively with the learning environment. They were also put in challenging
situations where they developed resilience and courage. It was an unforgettable
experience for the students and it will definitely stay with them for a
long time.</p>
