### **Events and Programmes**

#### National Day Celebration
This year’s National Day theme ‘Onward As One’ calls upon Singaporeans to look forward confidently and move onward together in building our shared future as one united people. As part of the National Day celebrations in school, interactive activity stations were set up during recess on August 3, 2023. Students were engaged in solving quizzes about Singapore and National Day on iPads. They also indulged in colouring and captured memories at the photo booth. CCE Ambassadors and National Day committee teachers organised and facilitated the activities, ensuring a seamless experience for all Peiying students.

During the National Day Ceremonial segment, students solemnly observed the Colour Party bringing in the State flag and school flag with pride. After which, the school celebrated Singapore’s birthday with the singing of National Day songs and a Peiying Fashion Parade where teachers and students paraded and danced down the hall to loud cheers from the whole school. 

What an enjoyable day for all! Happy Birthday Singapore! May you stay strong and resilient in the years to come!

#### English Language Fiesta
The English Language department had organised the English Language (EL) Fiesta from 30 March to 28 April 2023 to encourage students to read widely and be confident speakers. An array of events and activities were curated for the different levels, as well as those for the whole school. 
This year, the school had invited Mdm Cheng Puay Koon, our School Advisory Committee member and illustrator of a P2 STELLAR unit ‘Roti Prata’ to read and draw with the P2 students. In addition, the school invited students and staff to come to school dressed in the theme of ‘Superheroes’ on 31 March 2023. It was heartening to see the students dressed in characters such as princes, princesses and superheroes from the storybooks they like. <br><br>
To further encourage the love of reading, some of our students from P3 to P6 were invited to share their favourite stories during the Pre-Assembly periods. This activity had certainly captivated the students as they listened to the storybook reviews and excerpts of stories. The promotion of a reading culture is one of the cornerstones of the school and the EL Fiesta brings about the joy of reading through the activities designed for the students.

#### Annual Track and Field Meet 
We had our Annual Track and Field Meet (P3 to P6) on 7 March 2023 at Yishun Stadium. All students had the opportunity to participate in at least one relay event competing with other houses in the same level.<br><br>
The event was met with enthusiasm and excitement from the students as they participated in the various track and field events such as 4x100m Relay, Baton Relay, Ladder Running Relay, Long Rope Skipping Relay and Egg Spoon Relay. <br><br>
The event’s goal was to apply the motor skills learnt in Athletics in the PE syllabus to cultivate our PRIDE values as well as to promote our school’s vision – Lifelong Learners, Leaders of Character. It also developed the camaraderie in students as they compete, cheer on their house mates and interact with their peers. We are confident that such sports opportunities in school will motivate the students to go on to pursue other sports-related endeavors in the future.

#### P5 Camp
Our Primary 5 students attended the Outdoor Adventure Camp from 13-15 February 2023. The 3 days 2 nights camp was held at the MOE Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. Led by MOE’s Outdoor Adventure Educators (OAEs) and teachers, our students had the opportunity to experience learning through a variety of activities. These include the challenge rope course, team building activities, stream exploration and many more! The highlight of the camp was definitely the night walk, whereby students trekked through Dairy Farm Nature Park with just the moonlight illuminating the way.   

Through this camp, our students were actively engaged cognitively, physically and affectively with the learning environment. They were also put in challenging situations where they developed resilience and courage. It was an unforgettable experience for the students and it will definitely stay with them for a long time.

#### Chinese New Year Celebration
         
It has been a while since we were able to celebrate Chinese New Year together. In the days leading up to the celebrations, our teachers and students worked together to decorate the classrooms.

This year, we were delighted to welcome the year of the Rabbit with a face-to-face concert and a Lion Dance performance. Our teachers and students were entertained by the lion dance with many students eager to touch the lion and interact with the rabbit! They also enjoyed the Wushu performance put up by our very own student and the Peiying CNY Mass Dance choregraphed by our Mother Tongue Language teachers. We ended the concert with a joyous Sing-along session. &nbsp;

As we hop into the Year of the Rabbit, we would like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a Happy and Prosperous Chinese New Year.

#### Our P1’s First Day of School
It was an exciting day for our P1 students and their parents on their first day of school in Peiying Primary! Our P1 students were welcomed by teachers as they entered the school feeling excited and anxious at the same time. They were engaged in class activities and got to know their form and co-form teachers and their new classmates. Parents were invited to join their child and bond over food during recess time. Some managed to squeeze in some time to explore the school ground together after they had finished eating. At around 1 pm, it was time for our P1 students to go home. The students waved excitedly when they saw their parents at the school gate.

#### Racial Harmony Day 2022
Peiying commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 18 July 2022. This year’s theme, Our Multicultural Mosaic, revolves around the celebrating of diversity as we build on social cohesion in our harmonious society. Racial Harmony Day is also a poignant reminder of the racial riots that took place before Singapore’s independence.&nbsp;

  

Students and staff alike were dressed in their vibrant ethnic costumes on the commemoration day, which complements this year’s theme of a multicultural mosaic. The classroom activities carried out enhance the learning experience from the Assembly Programme. Not only did our students get to complete the class-based activities, they also had the opportunity to bring home a traditional game to be played with their family members.&nbsp;

  

Through these meaningful activities, students can better appreciate the importance of racial and religious harmony in a multicultural and multiracial Singapore.

#### Internationalisation Programme 2022

This year, Peiying Primary School embarked on a twinning programme with Sinfeng Elementary School in Taiwan. The aim of the programme is to develop students’ global awareness and cross-cultural skills through interaction with the students from another country. Our students had an online interaction with the students from Taiwan and they also exchanged hand-written postcards with one another.

#### Code for Fun 2022

Code for Fun is a full day programme where students were taught to create their own games through a drag-and-drop based programming software called Scratch. This year, Code for Fun was conducted for Primary 3 students on 13 July while Primary 4 students had their session on 14 July. At the start of the session, the students were given an introduction to game creation and  programming.  They familiarised themselves with the Scratch programming interface and proceeded to apply the learnt knowledge of using variables, conditionals, and simple loops in their programmes. At the end of the session, students utilised the programming concepts learnt to create exciting games related to environmental conservation.

#### Prize Presentation Day 2022

Peiying Primary School celebrated the accomplishments and milestones of all our award recipients, both staff and students, on Friday 18 November 2022. The theme for our Annual Prize Presentation Day is “Celebrating Accomplishments and Milestones”, which embodies the school’s mission in Building character, Enriching lives and Stretching PoTential to all in Peiying Primary School. 

This year, 4 of our teachers received the National Day Award and another 4 received the MOE Service Excellence Award (MSEA). In addition, 9 of our 2021 P6 students received TOP PSLE Performer Award.

To celebrate our aesthetic and sports accomplishments, our students from Modern Dance, Angklung, Skipping Club and Choir had put up spectacular performances to showcase their skills and talents. Our P6 students also wowed the audience with a surprise Flash Mob.

Our teachers continue to improve to work closely with all stakeholders to innovate the teaching processes, and to help our students realise their full potential so that they will thrive holistically and develop into Engaged Learners and Leaders of Character.

#### **NE Show 2022**
On 2nd July 2022, 180 Primary 5 students and 12 staff attended the National Education (NE) Show which was a preview of National Day Parade 2022. This year, the NE Show was held at The Float @ Marina Bay with Singapore’s city skyline as its magnificent backdrop. The theme for this year’s NDP is “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**”

The theme, “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**” is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as strong, united people towards a better future. “Stronger Together” also reminds us that our unity in diversity is what makes us stronger.

Our students viewed a showcase of Singapore’s defence capabilities and enjoyed the Singapore Story depicted by a colourful display of sights and sounds. For many students, it was their first time watching the NDP at the venue itself. The NE Show had certainly evoked a sense of patriotism amongst our students and imparted the significance of our National Day Parade to them.

#### **P4 Cultural Experience**

With relaxed safe management measures, the much-awaited P4 Cultural Experience took place on 13 July 2022.

Our Primary 4 students went for an eye-opening cultural experience to Kampung Glam. The purpose of the programme is to provide the experience for our students to appreciate the diversity of cultures and heritage in Singapore.&nbsp;

Our students learnt to identify spices used in local recipes, went on a walking trail around Kampung Glam and tried their hands at batik painting at the Aliwal Arts Centre. Everyone was amazed with the art pieces done by our students. We never knew we had so many budding artists! It was also a good opportunity for bonding among schoolmates and they got to develop character values and life skills.

#### **Earth Month 2022**

Peiying Primary School commemorates Earth Day annually with a myriad of eco-friendly activities to emphasise the importance of environmental sustainability and eco-stewardship.

Students were given opportunities to champion environmentally friendly causes and one signature event is the Annual Upcycling Competition. This year, we received a record number of upcycled artefacts! This is a testament of how we can extend the life of existing resources instead of wasting them. With our creativity, we can even come up with unique and interesting masterpieces! We hope to be an inspiration to others to practice upcycling in their daily lives.

We also touched on focus topics such as the Energy Crisis we are facing, on top of Global Warming and Climate Change. For an authentic and impactful learning experience, we had a ‘10-minute electricity-free’ moment where all classes turned off the lights and fans. This taught students to appreciate the comfort and convenience electricity has been bringing us, and to be responsible users so that there would still be electricity for generations to come!

This year, we also had a school-community collaboration with Nee Soon South CC. Our school initiated a mini upcycled Origami Trash Bin project. All staff, students, parents and members of the Parents-Support-Group folded more than 4,500 pieces of origami trash bins made from used paper.&nbsp;

The Grassroot Advisor for Nee Soon South, Ms Carrie Tan, as well as four other grassroot leaders, visited our school on 4 May 2022 to join and support us in our community outreach efforts. Together with a class of students, they had a fun time folding origami trash bins!

These origami trash bins will soon be distributed at the food centres in Nee Soon South. We hope to kickstart a ‘Bring-Your-Own-Bin’ movement within our community where members of the public embrace the joy of ‘a simple act of upcycling’ that can also keep our dining spaces clean for the comfort of everyone!

#### **International Friendship Day 2022**
Peiying Primary School commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on 4th April 2022.The Chair for 2022 is Cambodia, so an emphasis was placed on the customs and traditions of the country.&nbsp; Not all the ten ASEAN countries were showcased due to time constraints. The PowerPoint presentation for the Assembly Period focused on Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar because of the similarities these countries shared with Singapore like the New Year and Dragon boat festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The theme for IFD 2022 was Singapore in Asia. There was information given about Singapore’s contribution to ASEAN countries during times of natural disasters and emergencies. The slides showed Singapore sending our soldiers, doctors, civil defence personnel, equipment, vaccines and financial aid to Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos and the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

For the CCE-FTGP lesson, the Primary One level did an activity to help them recognise the flags of the ASEAN countries. The Primary Two level learned greetings in different ASEAN country languages. The Primary Three level learned about the national flowers of the ASEAN countries. The Primary 4 to 6 countries had discussions on how ASEAN countries can help each other, how working as a cohesive community is beneficial and what commonalities ASEAN countries shared.&nbsp;

It was heartening to hear from various form teachers how the students recognised many of the flags and had meaningful conversations about how ASEAN countries need each other’s help in times of difficulties.

#### **Let’s Celebrate English with a Touch of Magic**
The annual English Language Fiesta was held on 28 March 2022 to 22 April 2022. It was organised by the English Department to encourage our students to speak good English, to be avid readers and to infuse creativity in their writing. This year’s theme was ‘Let’s Celebrate English with a Touch of Magic’. The students celebrated the English Language ‘with a touch of magic’ by participating in class activities like Readers’ Theatre, Poetry and Creative Writing. Guest readers were invited to share interesting stories held at the school library. The students also experienced ‘A Blind Date with a Book’.&nbsp;

On 1 April 2022, the staff and students were dressed up to the theme of ‘Magic and Enchantment’ and the school was filled with magical characters like fairies, wizards and witches. Our students were taken on a trip to their favourite magical wonderland where many book characters came alive in the school compound. These included storybook characters like Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and even Prince Charming. Instantly, Peiying Primary School was transformed into a land of magic!&nbsp; It was indeed a memorable event for the school.

#### **Friendship Week**
We commemorated Friendship Week on the first week of Term 2 (21 March 2022 - 1 April 2022). The theme for this year’s Friendship Week is Sustaining Friendships. The planned activities were a combined effort of the Art, MRL and CCE Departments. The activities aimed to strengthen peer support relationships among students.

It was a great opportunity for the students to show appreciation for their peers, and to foster stronger and more positive friendships. We started the week with an E-assembly talk. Primary 1 to Primary 3 students watched a skit - “We Can All Be Friends”, while Primary 4 to Primary 6 students learnt about “accepting our friends and their differences”.&nbsp;

Next, the students proceeded to make friendship bookmarks for their buddies in class. The students expressed their gratitude towards their buddies and exchanged their token of appreciation with one another. During recess, students also had the chance to explore books that were “friendship” themed! We hope that this Friendship Week would reinforce the importance of positive relationships built on trust, empathy and respect for one another.

#### **Peer Support Relationship in CCA**
Peer Support Relationships (PSR) initiative builds on our school's culture of care. It aims to create a supportive and caring environment so that our students would feel safe, accepted and empowered. All Peiying students were taught to be kind and caring, to identify their social circle of support, and recognise signs of distress between peers through our various PSR activities.&nbsp; This year, we extended the PSR activities to our CCAs. Through PSR in CCA, the students bonded with one another, and this strengthened their relationship with their fellow CCA members. They also learnt important skills like teamwork and communication as they participated in the games. At the end of the activities, they each chose a buddy and spent some time to get to know their buddy better.&nbsp; This PSR initiative has shown students that they are able to provide social and emotional support for one another, and it strongly resonates with our school’s belief that no child should be left behind.

#### **P3 and P4 Enrichment Programme**
With the aim of promoting oracy among students, the English department conducted several enrichment workshops for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students.  

Primary 3 students were engaged in Readers’ Theatre, which helped them to learn to express themselves appropriately, confidently, clearly, eloquently and expressively. They were also taught a variety of vocal techniques to present their stories.  

Primary 4 students had the opportunity to do Public Speaking, which helped them to learn the right public speaking skills in order to become an empathetic and effective communicator. The workshop also helped them gain confidence and motivation in delivering a narrative through positive reinforcement.

#### **Key Student Leaders’ Investiture Ceremony**
The Key Student Leaders’ Investiture Ceremony was held on 7 March 2022. This Investiture is held annually to formally appoint our Prefects and Junior Sports Leaders as key student leaders of the school.

This year’s ceremony was special as a livestream of the event was shown to the school community. Students and teachers were able to witness the formal appointment of our Key Student Leaders from their respective classrooms.

The Investiture was kick-started with a speech made by our 2022 Head Prefect and was followed by a speech from our Vice-Principal, Mr Abdul Rani. Both speeches reiterated the importance of demonstrating the school’s core values of PRIDE (Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Diligence and Empathy) while carrying out their respective duties.

Besides receiving their respective badges, our key student leaders also received a Congratulatory Card. This card seeks to affirm the student leaders’ appointment to their roles and to congratulate parents of their child’s achievement.

#### **Cyberwellness Week 2022**
Cyber Safety was the focus for the Cyberwelless Week this year. Through a digital drama show, students were introduced to healthy cybersecurity habits and the importance of balanced screen time. Through participating in the school activities, they came to understand the risks involved when using digital devices and engaging in online activities. Besides acquiring knowledge of online safety rules, students learnt how to prevent unauthorised access to their devices and online accounts, and learnt to be better equipped at becoming a responsible and smart digital citizen.
