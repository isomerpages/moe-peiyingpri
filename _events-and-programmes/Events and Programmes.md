### **Events and Programmes**
#### **NE Show 2022**
On 2nd July 2022, 180 Primary 5 students and 12 staff attended the National Education (NE) Show which was a preview of National Day Parade 2022. This year, the NE Show was held at The Float @ Marina Bay with Singapore’s city skyline as its magnificent backdrop. The theme for this year’s NDP is “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**”

The theme, “**Stronger Together, Majulah!**” is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as strong, united people towards a better future. “Stronger Together” also reminds us that our unity in diversity is what makes us stronger.

Our students viewed a showcase of Singapore’s defence capabilities and enjoyed the Singapore Story depicted by a colourful display of sights and sounds. For many students, it was their first time watching the NDP at the venue itself. The NE Show had certainly evoked a sense of patriotism amongst our students and imparted the significance of our National Day Parade to them.
