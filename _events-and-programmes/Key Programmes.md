<h4>Student-centric values-driven holistic education</h4>
<p>At Peiying Primary School, the underpinning philosophy of teaching and
learning is the belief that every child can learn, improve and fulfil his
potential to become contributing citizens. The school seeks to stretch
the potential of its students, build character and enrich lives. With the
student at the centre of the curriculum, the school adopts various pedagogies
to engage and motivate as we deliver content knowledge and skills with
the infusion of core values in a safe and nurturing environment. The key
programmes in the school are specially planned and designed to stretch
the potential in each and every child to make learning at Peiying fun and&nbsp;
meaningful.</p>
<h4>Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Project THINK (Thinking Holistic Innovative Networked Kids) for Home Earth since 2019</h4>
<p>Project THINK for Home Earth is focused on environment education and is
designed to enable P1 to P6 students to be ‘future-ready’. This is done
by enabling them to be environmentally literate individuals who can understand
environmental issues and how human decisions affect environmental quality.
Through this programme, students will learn how to use the knowledge they
have about the environment to problem-solve and derive innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Project THINK for Home Earth is dedicated to environmental education,
empowering Primary 1 to Primary 6 students to become ‘future-ready’ through
a comprehensive understanding of environmental issues and the impact of
human decisions on environmental quality. The program aims to cultivate
environmentally literate individuals who can effectively problem-solve
and create innovative solutions. Simultaneously, it is driven by a heartfelt
commitment to proactive environmental stewardship in the face of climate
change and ecological challenges. By fostering a generation of students
who not only comprehend the complexities of these issues but also embrace
values such as foresight and kindness towards both the environment and
one another, the initiative integrates 21st-century competencies like critical
thinking, collaboration, creativity, and communication. This holistic approach
encourages students to develop the skills necessary to navigate and address
global challenges while embedding a sense of responsibility, compassion,
and the joy of learning. Ultimately, the goal is to promote informed and
caring choices that positively impact communities and the planet, fostering
a future of learning where empathy and respect are at the core of their
actions.</p>

<h4>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</h4>
<p>A unique feature of Peiying Primary School is our ‘Adventure Tower’, which
supports the emphasis given to Sports and Outdoor Education. Sports and
Outdoor Education has a natural affordance for students to clarify and
act on their personal values and demonstrate positive emotions and social
behaviours. The interaction and problem-solving nature of sports and outdoor
education activities allows students to have numerous instances to communicate
and interact positively with others, source for information and as well
to think critically and creatively. These are important skills which are
necessary for 21st century living.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leveraging the school’s strengths in Sports and Outdoor Education, in
2014, we conceptualised Sports, Character Development and Adventure Learning
Experiences@Peiying - SCALE@Peiying as a Learning for Life Programme (LLP).
It is a 6-year sports and outdoor education programme that provides students
with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values,
cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their interaction
skills. SCALE@PEIYING resonates the importance of character development
as an integral part of holistic education and is aligned to MOE DOEs and
the school’s SVOs.</p>
<h4>Scientopia</h4>
<p>Scientopia is a Science board game that enhances the joy of learning.
It is a Peiying innovation that seeks to engage our students in the learning
of Science in a fun and interactive way. It is a board game that closely
parallels the Primary Science Syllabus, making its use in class seamless.
Scientopia helps students understand and appreciate the world around them
better. Scientopia is developed to incorporate values education in the
teaching and learning of Science. For instance, students learn that perseverance
and integrity are critical as a scientist works on their research and in
writing their research papers.</p>
<h4>MTL Innovative Projects</h4>
<p>In line with the culture of learning and innovation, the MTL department
develops T&amp;L programmes to cater to students’ needs, interests and
talents. CL Write &amp; Learn project integrates Experiential Learning
and Formative Assessment in the process of learning. It makes writing fun
for all lower primary students. The Tamil Language Oral Package is a customised
resource for lower primary students to learn TL oral skills in a fun, interesting
and authentic manner. The ebook project by P6 Malay Language students has
been extended to Language learning. The ebooks created by the students
are used to engage ML students in interactive language activities.</p>

<h4>P2 Sensory Experience: Fostering Empathy in the PRIDE Garden</h4>
<p><em>“Harvest with Care, A Future We Can Share!”</em>

<p>The Primary 2 Sensory Programme aims to nurture empathy in students by
connecting them with nature. In the PRIDE Garden, students engage with
plants like curry leaves, laksa leaves, and chili plants, exploring their
scents, textures, and roles in our daily lives. Through this hands-on experience,
students learn to appreciate the care and effort that goes into growing
these plants, fostering a deeper understanding of how all living things
rely on one another.</p>
<p>The programme highlights the importance of caring for the environment,
reducing waste, and maintaining clean surroundings. Students discover the
life cycle of plants and the dedication required to nurture them.</p>
<p>By interacting with the plants and reflecting on their impact, students
develop empathy for gardeners and the natural world. They are encouraged
to take this newfound empathy home by caring for a plant and practicing
sustainable habits.</p>
<p>This meaningful experience inspires students to show care for their environment,
embodying the message: “Harvest with Care, A Future We Can Share!”
