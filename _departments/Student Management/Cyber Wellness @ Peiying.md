<h4>Cyber Wellness @ Peiying&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At Peiying Primary School, we are dedicated to equipping our students
with the necessary skills to stay cyber-smart. This empowers them to become
responsible netizens who take accountability for their online actions while
safeguarding themselves from online threats. Our Cyber Wellness (CW) activities
are thoughtfully designed based on the three principles outlined in the
MOE Cyber Wellness Framework:</p>
