<h4>Assembly talks and Pre-assembly sharing of information</h4>
<p>This whole school approach creates awareness among our students and develops
a feeling of unity and a positive school culture among the students and
staff. We ride on these platforms to share expected behavioural outcomes
and instill self-discipline to our students.</p>
<h4>Student Behavioural Reflection</h4>
<p>At Peiying Primary, we use restorative questioning to guide our students
in reflecting on their actions, learning from their mistakes, and shifting
their thinking. This process encourages cognitive growth and helps students
understand the action-consequence model when offences occur. It’s all about
helping them make better choices and become more thoughtful, responsible
individuals.</p>
<h4>F.A.S.H.I.O.N. Checks</h4>
<p>At Peiying Primary, we believe our students take pride in their school
and wear their uniform with confidence! Looking sharp and well-groomed
is more than just about appearances—it shows that they’re ready to learn
and take on the day. To help reinforce this, we have regular checks on
fingernails, attire, shoes, socks, hair, and iron-on nametags. These checks
are all about teaching students to present themselves smartly, decently,
and with pride. If students fall short of the grooming and attire standards,
they’ll be reminded to make adjustments so they’re always looking their
best.</p>
<h4>Peer Support and Relationships (PSR) in CCA and class</h4>
<p>At Peiying Primary, we’re all about building a caring and inclusive school
culture where everyone feels safe, accepted, and ready to shine! Our activities
aren’t just about fun.&nbsp; They are designed to empower students to support
each other socially and emotionally. With exciting, hands-on experiences,
students pick up awesome skills like teamwork and communication—all while
bonding and having a blast together!</p>
<h4>Peer Buddy Leaders Training</h4>
<p>We’re on the lookout for students with a big heart and a love for making
friends! Those keen to become befrienders will be trained as Peer Buddy
Leaders to promote peer support and build strong relationships among students.
Through special training sessions, these Peer Buddy Leaders will gain the
skills and knowledge they need to spread our culture of care. They’ll create
connections, lend a helping hand, and inspire their peers to do the same—all
while making school life even more awesome!</p>
<h4>Pastoral Care</h4>
<p>At our school, we’ve got a fantastic lineup of pastoral care programmes
designed to help every student grow socially, emotionally, and build resilience.
These programmes cover important topics like Cyber Wellness, Anti-Bullying,
Crime Prevention, Preventive Drug Education, and Friendship. We’re all
about helping students become well-rounded, confident, and ready to take
on life’s challenges with a positive mindset!</p>
