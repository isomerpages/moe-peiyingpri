We aim to  

*   inculcate in every child a love for reading and an appreciation of a variety of genres.  

*   nurture pupils to become confident speakers and writers in a language-enriched environment.  
 
*   develop in pupils thinking skills to make critical judgements necessary for the globalised world.

The STELLAR Curriculum aims to:  

strengthen both language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundational years through a variety of learner-centred and developmentally appropriate pedagogical approaches using age-appropriate authentic children's literature.
