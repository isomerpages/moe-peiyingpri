<h4>EL Fiesta</h4>
<p>The Language Fiesta, a month-long event featuring a variety of activities,
is organised to help pupils to learn the English Language in a fun way.
It is in line with the national Speak Good English Movement, with the objective
of encouraging pupils to use grammatically correct English that is universally
understood. Throughout April, all pupils are involved in a host of engaging
EL activities at every level to raise awareness of the importance of English
Language, and encourage pupils to continue to speak and write standard
English throughout the year.</p>
<p>Various fun and meaningful activities are organised, which include Oratorical
Contest, Reader's Theatre, Choral Reading, Spelling Bee, quizzes and games.
English game booths, designed and conducted by the EL Club members and
EL Ambassadors feature fun language games for the pupils to play during
recess.</p>
<p>Characters from popular children’s books also come alive, such as Pinocchio
and Little Red Riding Hood, as they mingle among the Peiying students and
converse about their storybook roles.’</p>

<h4><strong>English Reading Programmes @ Peiying</strong></h4>
<h4>Extended Reading Programme</h4>
<p>A wide selection of engaging books is available for all levels across
the school. These books are housed in the classroom library corners, where
English Ambassadors oversee the borrowing and loaning process.</p>
<p>The programme is integrated with the Peiying Reader Card reading activity,
which motivates pupils to complete a series of tasks related to their reading.
Activities such as designing a poster based on the book or writing a letter
to the main character are tailored to accommodate different learning abilities
and interests, ensuring a meaningful and enjoyable reading experience for
every student.</p>
<h4><br>Let’s Read Programme<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The subscription to the <em>Little Red Dot</em> newspaper ensures that Primary
4, 5, and 6 students are consistently exposed to current affairs and expository
writing throughout the year. Through engaging, age-appropriate articles,
students enhance their grammar and vocabulary while deepening their understanding
of various topics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, National Education messages are seamlessly incorporated
into English lessons, fostering meaningful discussions on themes highlighted
in each issue.</p>
<p>The Reading Programme gives exposure to P1, P2 and P3 pupils to a wide
variety of text types, such as storybooks and magazines. It promotes reading
and fosters a love of books and literature through motivating stories.</p>
<h4>Media Resource Library (MRL) - READ @ Peiying<br></h4>
<p>READ @ Peiying refers to Reading Extensively Aids UnDerstanding both in
and out of the classrooms. The MRL believes in the whole-school approach
to develop a school-wide reading culture, so students would need access
to a wide variety of books and school-wide programmes, and initiatives
should be made available with a structured time set aside to allow for
reading for pleasure.</p>
<p>These initiatives include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>providing ERP books for their class libraries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pocket-Size Programmes on various genres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guest Readers who conduct storytelling for P1 to P3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organising a Mobile Library every month at the canteen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blind date with a book</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school also partners with public libraries to conduct reading activities.</p>

<h4>P3 and P4 Oracy Programme</h4>
<p>To promote oracy among students, the English Department organises an annual
enrichment workshop for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students.</p>
<p>Primary 3 students participate in Readers’ Theatre, where they learn to
express themselves confidently, clearly, eloquently, and with appropriate
expression. The workshop also introduces various vocal techniques to help
them effectively bring stories to life.</p>
<p>Primary 4 students attend a Public Speaking workshop which equips them
with essential skills to become empathetic and effective communicators.
Through positive reinforcement, the workshop boosts their confidence and
motivation, enabling them to deliver a speech with impact.
