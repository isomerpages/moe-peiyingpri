We aim to  

*   inculcate in every child a love for reading and an appreciation of a variety of genres.  

*   nurture pupils to become confident speakers and writers in a language-enriched environment.  
 
*   develop in pupils thinking skills to make critical judgements necessary for the globalised world.

The STELLAR Curriculum aims to:  

strengthen both language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundational years through a variety of learner-centred and developmentally appropriate pedagogical approaches using age-appropriate authentic children's literature.

The STELLAR pedagogic model for **lower** primary is made up of three major teaching strategies:

* Shared Book Approach (SBA)

* Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)

* Learning Centres (LC)

  

The STELLAR pedagogic model for **upper** primary is made up of three major teaching strategies:

* Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) (Supported Reading, KWL, Retelling)

* Writing Process Cycle (WPC)

* Differentiated Instruction (DI)

##### **2\. EL Fiesta**

The Language Fiesta, a month-long event featuring a variety of activities, is organised to help pupils to learn the English Language in a fun way. It is in line with the national Speak Good English Movement, with the objective of encouraging pupils to use grammatically correct English that is universally understood. Throughout April, all pupils are involved in a host of engaging EL activities at every level to raise awareness of the importance of English Language, and encourage pupils to continue to speak and write standard English throughout the year.

Various fun and meaningful activities are organised, which include Oratorical Contest, Reader's Theatre, Choral Reading, Spelling Bee, quizzes and games. English game booths, designed and conducted by the EL Club members and EL Ambassadors feature fun language games for the pupils to play during recess.

Characters from popular children’s books also come alive, such as Pinocchio and Little Red Riding Hood, as they mingle among the Peiying students and converse about their storybook roles.

##### **3. Extended Reading Programme**

A variety of interesting books have been provided for all levels in the school. These books are found in the classroom library corners, where the English Ambassadors will coordinate the loaning of books borrowed.

The programme is pegged with the TicTacToe reading activity, which encourages pupils to complete a set of connection activities. These connection activities (such as designing a poster of the book read and writing a letter to the main character) are designed to provide differentiation for learning abilities and interests of pupils.

##### **4. Little Red Dot**

The subscription of the newspaper The Straits Times and its supplement, Little Red Dot, ensure that P4 & P5 pupils are exposed to current affairs and expository writing throughout the year.

There is an enhancement of grammar and vocabulary through exposure to the various articles targeted at the primary school pupils. National Education messages are also infused into the EL lessons through the discussion of topics highlighted in every issue.

##### **5. Let's Read Programme**

The Reading Programme gives exposure to P1, P2 and P3 pupils to a wide variety of text types, such as storybooks and magazines. It promotes reading and fosters a love of books and literature through motivating stories.

##### **6. Media Resource Library (MRL) - READ @ Peiying**

<img src="/images/english9.png" style="width:55%" align=left><b></b>
READ @ Peiying refers to **R**eading **E**xtensively **A**ids Un**D**erstanding both in and out of the classrooms. The MRL believes in the whole-school approach to develop a school-wide reading culture, so students would need access to a wide variety of books and school-wide programmes, and initiatives should be made available with a structured time set aside to allow for reading for pleasure.

These initiatives include
*	providing ERP books for their class libraries
*	Pocket-Size Programmes on various genres
*	Guest Readers who conduct storytelling for P1 to P3
*	Organising a Mobile Library every month at the canteen

The school also partners with public libraries to conduct reading activities.
