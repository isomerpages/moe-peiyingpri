We aim to  

*   inculcate in every child a love for reading and an appreciation of a variety of genres.  

*   nurture pupils to become confident speakers and writers in a language-enriched environment.  
 
*   develop in pupils thinking skills to make critical judgements necessary for the globalised world.

The STELLAR Curriculum aims to:  

strengthen both language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundational years through a variety of learner-centred and developmentally appropriate pedagogical approaches using age-appropriate authentic children's literature.

The STELLAR pedagogic model for **lower** primary is made up of three major teaching strategies:

* Shared Book Approach (SBA)

* Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)

* Learning Centres (LC)

  

The STELLAR pedagogic model for **upper** primary is made up of three major teaching strategies:

* Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) (Supported Reading, KWL, Retelling)

* Writing Process Cycle (WPC)

* Differentiated Instruction (DI)

The Language Fiesta, a month-long event featuring a variety of activities, is organised to help pupils to learn the English Language in a fun way. It is in line with the national Speak Good English Movement, with the objective of encouraging pupils to use grammatically correct English that is universally understood. Throughout April, all pupils are involved in a host of engaging EL activities at every level to raise awareness of the importance of English Language, and encourage pupils to continue to speak and write standard English throughout the year.

Various fun and meaningful activities are organised, which include Oratorical Contest, Reader's Theatre, Choral Reading, Spelling Bee, quizzes and games. English game booths, designed and conducted by the EL Club members and EL Ambassadors feature fun language games for the pupils to play during recess.
