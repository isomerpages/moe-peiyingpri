We aim to provide platforms for pupils to actively learn Mother Tongue Languages and the associated culture so as to experience Mother Tongue Languages as ‘living languages’  

Students are immersed in a variety of level appropriate activities throughout the two weeks.  
  
These include singing competitions, chinese calligraphy workshops, dikir barat, mask making, learning journey's to the Indian Heritage Centre and e-book competitions.
