<h4>Student Digital Literacy Programme @ Peiying</h4>
<p>The School provides opportunity for each child to engage in Self-directed
Learning and Collaborative Learning in an Wireless Environment digitally-rich
in information communication tools.</p>
<p>Peiying students will have the opportunity to engage in learning activities
utilising a variety of ICT platforms. They are infocomm-savvy and digitally
ready to harness the potential of ICT in meeting the technology-driven
needs of the future.</p>
<h4>Students Digital Literacy and Technological Skills</h4>
<p><strong>ICT Baseline Skills:</strong>
</p>
<p>The school programme begins by establishing a strong foundation in ICT
baseline skills such as Touch Typing and Device Familiarity &amp; Operations
at the lower primary.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging Digital Platforms for Enhanced Learning:</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond the ICT baseline skills, our school programme also focuses on integrating
digital tools into the curriculum to create engaging and enriching learning
experiences for our students. We leverage the power of commonly used applications
and online digital platforms such as Microsoft applications and Google
Workspace for Education to enhance teaching and learning at the middle
and upper primary levels.&nbsp;</p>

<br><strong>Code For Fun:</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our post-PSLE program, our Primary 6 students participate in
a 10-hour "Code For Fun" workshop designed to introduce them to the exciting
world of technology and computational thinking. This workshop covers a
range of key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Computational Thinking:</strong> Students will learn four fundamental
computational thinking techniques, providing them with a structured approach
to problem-solving applicable across various disciplines. These techniques
include decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm
design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programming and Robotics with Sphero Bolt:</strong> Our students&nbsp;
will gain hands-on experience programming and controlling Sphero Bolt robots.
This practical application will solidify their understanding of coding
concepts and introduce them to the basics of robotics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> The workshop provides an
introduction to the concepts of artificial intelligence, exploring how
machines can learn and perform tasks that require human intelligence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Recognizing the importance of online safety,
students will learn about cyber attacks and security. This section will
cover potential online threats and equip them with strategies to protect
themselves and their data in the digital world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
