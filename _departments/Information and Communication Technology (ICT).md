<h5><strong>3. Cyberwellness Education</strong></h5>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students
to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students
should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible
use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology
for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive
use of technology for the good of the community.</p>
