##### **1. Primary 5 Camp**

The Primary 5 camp is an annual 3day & 2night camp. Campers, ex-Peiying pupils cum instructors and all teachers are involved in this yearly affair. A wide variety of indoor and outdoor activities would be planned for the students.  The main highlight of each camp would be the Campfire, held on the second night of the camp. Campers would put up performances and sing songs during the 2 hour sessions. Four best camper awards would also be given out and an all-round best camper per house would be awarded as well.

Every year, the Primary 2 cohort are treated to an exciting CCA Fair at the Multi-Purpose Court. It is an exciting time for the Primary 2 students as they consider their options of which CCA they are interested to join. They listen to their peers’ CCA experiences as well as witness the eye catching displays put up by the various CCAs from Sports and Games, Performing Arts, Clubs and Societies and Uniformed Groups. The fair gives them an opportunity to explore the different CCAs available to them, thus helping them in deciding the CCA of their choice in Primary 3.

##### **4. Camp PRIDE**

Camp PRIDE is an annual day camp which we organise for sports leaders from the N6 cluster schools. 

The activities during the camp consist of High Rope Element Course and Intermediate Wall at our Peiying Primary School Adventure Centre, Team Building Games and Leadership Segment, Orienteering at the Yishun Neighbourhood Park as well as First Aid and Tent Pitching. 

These activities are designed to provide our sports leaders with the learning experiences as well as opportunities to perform so as to develop their leadership skills and Social Emotional Competencies and instill the PRIDE values in them.
