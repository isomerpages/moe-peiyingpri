<h4>Mastering Problem-Solving: Heuristics and Problem Concepts (HPC) in Mathematics</h4>
<p>Our Mathematics programme equips all students with essential problem-solving
skills through the explicit teaching of heuristics such as <em>Guess &amp; Check,</em>  <em>Listing </em>etc,
as well as problem concepts such as <em>Total Unchanged</em>, <em>Repeated Identity, Gaps &amp; Difference </em>etc.
HPC apply across all topics, giving students tools for versatile and adaptable
learning, empowering them to become confident and effective problem solvers.
Students develop critical thinking skills to approach and solve complex
mathematical problems systematically. The skills learned are not just for
Mathematics but also for real-world problem-solving and future academic
pursuits.</p>

<h4>E2K Mathematics: Unlocking the Mathematician Within</h4>
<p>The E2K Mathematics programme in Peiying is an enrichment initiative designed
for selected Primary 4 &amp; Primary 5 high-progress learners in Mathematics.
A collaboration between the Gifted Education Branch, MOE, and our school,
the programme fosters mathematical reasoning and deepens conceptual understanding
through inquiry-based learning. Students engage in independent and collaborative
mathematical explorations using resources like puzzles, games, and specially
designed activities. These rich experiences nurture habits and attitudes
of mathematicians while equipping students with essential 21st-century
competencies such as critical thinking, inventive thinking, and effective
communication skills.</p>

<h4>Learning Beyond Classrooms: Fun$mart for Young Mathematicians</h4>
<p>The Fun$mart programme engages Primary 1 to Primary 3 students by linking
Mathematics to real-world contexts through authentic learning. Students
explore mathematically rich environments in their neighbourhood, enhancing
their awareness and appreciation of Mathematics in daily life. The programme
includes exciting online activities in the <em>Student Learning Space</em> (SLS)
during holidays and interactive Math trail sessions during Mathematics
lessons. Through these experiences, students not only build a deeper understanding
of mathematical concepts but also acquire vital cognitive and communication
skills, fostering holistic development.</p>

<h4>Mathematics Made Accessible: Supporting LSM Learners</h4>
<p>The Learning Support Mathematics (LSM) programme at our school provides
early intervention for selected Primary 1 to Primary 4 students who require
additional help in building foundational numeracy skills. With a small
teacher-student ratio, the programme ensures personalized attention, enabling
each child to progress at their own pace. LSM focuses on equipping students
with essential mathematical knowledge, skills, and confidence to excel
in the primary school curriculum. Through targeted support, LSM empowers
students to overcome challenges and achieve success in Mathematics. Beyond
academic growth, LSM fosters problem-solving skills, resilience, and a
growth mindset.&nbsp;</p>
