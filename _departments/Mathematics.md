<h5><strong>1. Fun$mart Programme</strong></h5>

</div>
<p>The Fun$mart programme enables pupils to connect Mathematics to the real-world
context through authentic learning. It provides an opportunity for parents
to engage in their child’s learning and raise their child’s awareness in
the mathematically rich environments in their neighbourhood through accomplishing
a series of activities in the booklet during holidays. Pupils would inevitably
acquire cognitive and communication skills in Mathematics.</p>
<h5><strong>2. P5 STEM Programme</strong></h5>
<p>P5 STEM programme was initiated by the Mathematics department in collaboration
with the Science and Information &amp; Communication Technology departments
in 2021. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.
As it is a new programme, the school piloted with only two P5 classes last
year. In 2022, we offered the opportunity to all P5 students. Two classes
have embarked on the programme in Term 2 while the rest of the students
will commence theirs in Term 3.</p>
<p>This year’s theme, Forensic Science, ties in with the life Science topics
that students learn. During the lessons, students learnt the role of forensic
Science in crime investigation and they were tasked to solve mysteries
through analysis of fingerprints and footprints, perform ink chromatography
and decode codes and ciphers. They even extracted DNA from strawberries!
At the end of the programme, students would collaborate to gather evidence
and perform data analysis to solve a simulated crime scene. We certainly
cannot wait to see the teams’ presentations on their findings and conclusions!</p>

<h5><strong>3. Learning Support for Mathematics</strong></h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/math4.jpg">
</div>
<p>This early intervention programme provides an opportunity for the identified
Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils to acquire foundational numeracy skills
and knowledge, and build their confidence in Mathematics to access the
lower Primary Mathematics curriculum. Due to its small teacher-pupil ratio
structure, a greater attention is given to each pupil and a closer monitoring
of individual learning progress is provided. These pupils learn Mathematics
through various hands-on strategies and game-based activities.</p>
<h5><strong>4. Banded Math Remediation</strong></h5>
<p>The chosen Primary 3 and Primary 4 pupils in this after-school programme
are banded according to their learning progress and aptitude in Mathematics.
A more targeted approach is given these pupils to better match their learning
pace and address their learning gaps.</p>
<h5><strong>5. Math pull-out programme</strong></h5>
<p>This pull-out programme provides an opportunity for the selected Primary
5 and Primary 6 pupils to gain factual and procedural fluencies through
a series of structured scaffolds and games provided for them. These pupils
will gain conceptual understanding through various hands-on activities.</p>
<h5><strong>6. Math workshop for parents</strong></h5>
<p>The workshop aims to enhance pupils’ factual fluency through the use of
Mathematics manipulatives and games. In the workshop, parents learn to
design games and create Mathematics manipulatives to better engage pupils
in learning Mathematics facts. Through a series of Mathematics games, pupils
will attain a level of mastery that enables them to retrieve Mathematics
facts for long-term memory without conscious effort or attention. When
pupils achieve automaticity with these facts, they would have greater computational
accuracy in Mathematics.</p>
