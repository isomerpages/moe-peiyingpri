We aim to  

*   ignite our pupils’ passion for Mathematics  
 
*   build our pupils’ confidence in Mathematics  
 
*   enable our pupils to acquire cognitive and metacognitive skills  

*   nurture independent lifelong learners and innovative problem solvers

##### **1. Fun$mart Programme**

The Fun$mart programme enables pupils to connect Mathematics to the real-world context through authentic learning. It provides an opportunity for parents to engage in their child’s learning and raise their child’s awareness in the mathematically rich environments in their neighbourhood through accomplishing a series of activities in the booklet during holidays. Pupils would inevitably acquire cognitive and communication skills in Mathematics.

##### **2. P5 STEM Programme**
P5 STEM programme was initiated by the Mathematics department in collaboration with the Science and Information & Communication Technology departments in 2021. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. As it is a new programme, the school piloted with only two P5 classes last year. In 2022, we offered the opportunity to all P5 students. Two classes have embarked on the programme in Term 2 while the rest of the students will commence theirs in Term 3.

This year’s theme, Forensic Science, ties in with the life Science topics that students learn. During the lessons, students learnt the role of forensic Science in crime investigation and they were tasked to solve mysteries through analysis of fingerprints and footprints, perform ink chromatography and decode codes and ciphers. They even extracted DNA from strawberries! At the end of the programme, students would collaborate to gather evidence and perform data analysis to solve a simulated crime scene. We certainly cannot wait to see the teams’ presentations on their findings and conclusions!

##### **3. Learning Support for Mathematics**

This early intervention programme provides an opportunity for the identified Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils to acquire foundational numeracy skills and knowledge, and build their confidence in Mathematics to access the lower Primary Mathematics curriculum. Due to its small teacher-pupil ratio structure, a greater attention is given to each pupil and a closer monitoring of individual learning progress is provided. These pupils learn Mathematics through various hands-on strategies and game-based activities.

##### **4. Banded Math Remediation**
The chosen Primary 3 and Primary 4 pupils in this after-school programme are banded according to their learning progress and aptitude in Mathematics. A more targeted approach is given these pupils to better match their learning pace and address their learning gaps.

##### **5. Math pull-out programme**
This pull-out programme provides an opportunity for the selected Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils to gain factual and procedural fluencies through a series of structured scaffolds and games provided for them. These pupils will gain conceptual understanding through various hands-on activities.

##### **6. Math workshop for parents**
The workshop aims to enhance pupils’ factual fluency through the use of Mathematics manipulatives and games. In the workshop, parents learn to design games and create Mathematics manipulatives to better engage pupils in learning Mathematics facts. Through a series of Mathematics games, pupils will attain a level of mastery that enables them to retrieve Mathematics facts for long-term memory without conscious effort or attention. When pupils achieve automaticity with these facts, they would have greater computational accuracy in Mathematics.
