<h4>Fun$mart Programme</h4>
<p>The Fun$mart programme enables pupils to connect Mathematics to the real-world
context through authentic learning. It provides an opportunity for parents
to engage in their child’s learning and raise their child’s awareness in
the mathematically rich environments in their neighbourhood through accomplishing
a series of activities in the booklet during holidays. Pupils would inevitably
acquire cognitive and communication skills in Mathematics.</p>
<h4>Learning Support for Mathematics</h4>
<p>This early intervention programme provides an opportunity for the identified
Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils to acquire foundational numeracy skills
and knowledge, and build their confidence in Mathematics to access the
lower Primary Mathematics curriculum. Due to its small teacher-pupil ratio
structure, a greater attention is given to each pupil and a closer monitoring
of individual learning progress is provided. These pupils learn Mathematics
through various hands-on strategies and game-based activities.</p>
<h4>Banded Math Remediation</h4>
<p>The chosen Primary 3 and Primary 4 pupils in this after-school programme
are banded according to their learning progress and aptitude in Mathematics.
A more targeted approach is given these pupils to better match their learning
pace and address their learning gaps.</p>
<h4>Math pull-out programme</h4>
<p>This pull-out programme provides an opportunity for the selected Primary
5 and Primary 6 pupils to gain factual and procedural fluencies through
a series of structured scaffolds and games provided for them. These pupils
will gain conceptual understanding through various hands-on activities.</p>
