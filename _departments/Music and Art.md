<h5><strong>1. Handbells</strong></h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/music1.png">
</div>
<p>At Primary 1, our students are introduced to handbells. They will go through
4 lessons to master the basic skills of playing the handbells, learn about
hand-eye coordination, distinguish the sound of different pitches and the
importance of team work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides learning to play simple rhythms, the students also learn to play
the song Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars, which they perform in small groups
in class. This gives them the opportunity to be exposed to basic performance
and stage etiquette.</p>
<h5><strong>2. Digital Music</strong></h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/music2.png">
</div>
<p>Our Primary 2 students go through a series of 8 lessons to develop their
musicianship through exploration of music arrangements using GarageBand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the lessons, they acquire basic skills and knowledge related to
music production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They learn to record and mix their own composition and arrangements. They
learn to apply knowledge of essential music elements such as form, structure,
melody, rhythm etc. At the same time, our students get to discover and
express themselves musically. They are given the opportunity to communicate
and present their ideas confidently and to embrace the joy of learning.</p>
<h5><strong>3. Boomwhackers</strong></h5>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:45%;margin-right:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/music3.png">
</div>
<p>Our students have the opportunity to learn to play the boomwhackers for
a term at Primary 5. They learn to understand the usage of boomwhackers,
playing a simple song as an ensemble and experience layering of ostinato
rhythms. Through these activities, students learn to demonstrate musical
abilities such as following the conductor’s lead and to coordinate confidently
with their peers to complete an ensemble performance. They learn to apply
fundamental musical skills such as listening and musical abilities as required
in an ensemble playing.</p>

<h5><strong>1. P1 Oil Pastel Blending Enrichment Programme(AMIS)</strong></h5>
<p>Our students took colouring to the next level by applying the colour blending
technique in their art work. They were taught to&nbsp;apply, manipulate,
and&nbsp;blend oil pastels&nbsp;in a multitude of ways to achieve different
effects, hues, and textures to emphasise details in an art work.</p>
<h5><strong>2. P2 Acrylic Painting on Canvas Enrichment Programme (AMIS)</strong></h5>
<p>The process of exploration is one of the most exciting things about acrylic
painting! Under the guidance of experienced instructors, students try their
hand at acrylic painting on canvas which is a new experience to them, and
create texture-rich and vibrant art pieces.</p>
<h5><strong>3. P3-P6 Arts and Cultural Experience Programme (ACE) - Visual Arts</strong></h5>
<p>P3: WAU Kite Making
<br>P4: Clay Diya
<br>P5: Chinese Painting
<br>P6: Printmaking</p>
<p>Art constitutes important ways of knowing and learning about self, others
and the world around us. It is a form of language through which personal
meanings are generated and cultural identities are formed. Our ACE visual
arts programme from P3-6 provides an avenue for our students to develop
self and social awareness and appreciate our unique Singaporean forms of
expression that are anchored on national values as well as understand and
appreciate cultures and traditions beyond Singapore. This enables our students
to develop respect for themselves and others, value harmony and thereby
cultivating their global awareness and cross cultural skills for the 21st
century.</p>
