##### **1. Handbells**

At Primary 1, our students are introduced to handbells. They will go through 4 lessons to master the basic skills of playing the handbells, learn about hand-eye coordination, distinguish the sound of different pitches and the importance of team work. 


Besides learning to play simple rhythms, the students also learn to play the song Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars, which they perform in small groups in class. This gives them the opportunity to be exposed to basic performance and stage etiquette.

##### **2. Digital Music**

Our Primary 2 students go through a series of 8 lessons to develop their musicianship through exploration of music arrangements using GarageBand. 

Through the lessons, they acquire basic skills and knowledge related to music production. 

They learn to record and mix their own composition and arrangements. They learn to apply knowledge of essential music elements such as form, structure, melody, rhythm etc. At the same time, our students get to discover and express themselves musically. They are given the opportunity to communicate and present their ideas confidently and to embrace the joy of learning.

##### **3. Boomwhackers**

Our students have the opportunity to learn to play the boomwhackers for a term at Primary 5. They learn to understand the usage of boomwhackers, playing a simple song as an ensemble and experience layering of ostinato rhythms. Through these activities, students learn to demonstrate musical abilities such as following the conductor’s lead and to coordinate confidently with their peers to complete an ensemble performance. They learn to apply fundamental musical skills such as listening and musical abilities as required in an ensemble playing.
