<p>Some key initiative/ programmes that students' will be exposed to in their
6 years include:</p>
<h4>Integrating ICT to Enrich Art Learning Experiences</h4>
<p>The Art Department has integrated Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) tools into modules from P1 to P6, enabling students to explore creative
possibilities beyond traditional methods and fostering both artistic expression
and 21st-century skills. ICT is also used to facilitate collaborative learning,
allowing students to share ideas and receive constructive feedback from
peers and teachers. This integration enriches the art learning experience
by promoting innovation, enhancing collaboration, and balancing creativity
across both digital and traditional artistic practices.</p>
<h4>Fostering Collaborative Learning in Art</h4>
<p>Collaborative learning is embedded in the customised art curriculum in
initiatives such as the Primary 3 "Sea Creature Exploration" and the Primary
4 "Making Thinking Visible through Artful Discussions." These activities
promote teamwork, critical thinking, and communication skills, as students
co-create artworks and engage in reflective discussions that deepen their
understanding of artistic concepts.</p>
