Assembly talks and Pre-assembly sharing of information</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>This whole school approach creates awareness among our students and develops a feeling of unity and a positive school culture among the students and staff. We ride on these platforms to share expected behavioural outcomes and instill self-discipline to our students.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Student Behavioural Reflection</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>We use restorative questioning to help our students reflect, learn from mistake, and change their thinking through cognitive processing and the action-consequence model if offences are committed.</p></li></ul><p><strong>3. F.A.S.H.I.O.N. Checks</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>We believe that our students are proud of their school and wear their school uniform with pride. Having proper attire and grooming is an outward expression of the students being ready to learn. Hence the regular checks on Fingernails, Attire, Shoes and Socks, Hair, and Iron-On-Nametag aim to educate our students to look smart, decent and presentable at all times. Students who fail to meet the grooming and attire standard of the school will be required to rectify it.</p></li></ul><p><strong>4. Peer Support and Relationships (PSR) in CCA and class</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>These activities build on our school’s culture of care so that our students would feel safe, accepted, and empowered. Students are empowered to provide social and emotional support for one another. Through fun and experiential activities in this programme, they learn important skills like teamwork and communication.</p></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:49%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sm1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:49%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sm2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:99.9%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sm3.jpg"></div><p><strong>5. Peer Buddy Leaders Training</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Selected students who are keen to be befrienders will also be trained as Peer Buddy Leaders to promote peer support and relationship among students. Peer Buddy Leaders will attend training so as to be equipped with knowledge and skills to spread this culture of care through peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing.</p></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:99.9%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sm4.jpg"></div><p><strong>6.
