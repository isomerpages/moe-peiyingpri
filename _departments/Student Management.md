We aim to  
*   adopt a whole-school approach to positive discipline so as to instill self-discipline in our students
*   provide a tiered system of support for different segments of students
*   develop a culture of care
*   strengthen peer support and relationships and pastoral care

1\.  Assembly talks and Pre-assembly sharing of information

*   This whole school approach creates awareness among our students and develops a feeling of unity and a positive school culture among the students and staff. They are suitable platforms to share expected behavioural outcomes and instill self-discipline.

2\. Student Behavioural Reflection

*   We use restorative questioning to help our students reflect and change their thinking through cognitive processing and the action-consequence model if offences are committed.

3\. F.A.S.H.I.O.N. Checks

*   We believe that our students are proud of their school and wear their school uniform with pride. Having proper attire and grooming is an outward expression of the students being ready to learn. Hence the regular checks on Fingernails, Attire, Shoes and Socks, Hair, and Ironed-On-Nametag aims to educate our students to look smart, decent and presentable at all times. Students who fail to meet the grooming and attire standard of the school will be required to rectify it.

4\. Peer Support and Relationships (PSR) in CCA and class

*   These activities build on our schoolâ€™s culture of care so that our students would feel safe, accepted, and empowered. Students are empowered to provide social and emotional support for one another. Through fun and experiential activities in this programme, they learn important skills like teamwork and communication.
