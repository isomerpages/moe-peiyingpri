<p>Vision: <em>Inquisitive, analytical, and resourceful learners ready for the future</em>
</p>
<p>Mission statement: We are committed to fostering a dynamic learning environment
that nurtures curiosity, creativity, and confidence in our students. Guided
by the principles of Inspire, Inquire, and Innovate, we empower learners
to become inquisitive, analytical, and resourceful thinkers, ready to navigate
an ever-evolving future.</p>
<p>The objectives of the Science Department are centered around three key
principles, reflecting the vision of the Science Curriculum Framework,
which emphasizes the three “IN”s: Inspire, Inquire, and Innovate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>I</strong>nspire Curiosity and a Passion for Learning
<br>We aim to ignite learners' interest in science through engaging hands-on
experiences that connect scientific concepts to real-world phenomena. This
approach not only makes learning enjoyable but also highlights the relevance
of science in addressing global challenges, motivating learners to consider
careers that contribute positively to society.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I</strong>nquire Like Scientists
<br>The department focuses on developing learners' critical thinking and inquiry
skills. Learners are encouraged to ask questions, analyze information,
and evaluate evidence thoughtfully. By fostering a mindset of curiosity
and skepticism, they learn to approach problems systematically, enhancing
their ability to make informed decisions and preparing them to demonstrate
tenacity in the face of adversity in the future.<strong><br></strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I</strong>nnovate Solutions and Foster Ethical Awareness
<br>Learners are inspired to creatively apply their scientific knowledge to
develop innovative solutions for real-world problems. The department emphasizes
the importance of ethical awareness, prompting learners to reflect on the
societal implications of scientific practices and engage in meaningful
discussions about socioscientific issues, equipping them to articulate
their perspectives responsibly.</p>

<h4>Science Enrichment Programme</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Department/SC1.png">
</div>
<p>The Science Enrichment Program is designed to ignite curiosity and inspire
students to explore beyond the standard curriculum by enhancing their critical
and inventive thinking skills. It aims to build their confidence in conducting
investigations and tackling complex, non-routine problems while nurturing
a genuine passion for science. The programme encourages students to apply
scientific concepts to create innovative solutions for real-world challenges,
ranging from everyday issues to complex global problems. The goal is to
cultivate a strong pipeline of students ready to contribute to STEM research,
innovation, and enterprise in an ever-evolving world.
<br>
</p>
<h4>Elementz</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Department/SC2.png">
</div>
<p>The programme aims to ignite a passion for scientific inquiry in emerging
researchers. It guides students through a structured investigative process,
helping them embody the school's PRIDE values while engaging with scientific
principles. By enhancing scientific literacy, the programme equips students
to apply scientific concepts in daily life and make informed decisions.
Inquiry-based learning encourages curiosity and critical thinking, while
the Elementz Science Competition offers a platform for students to showcase
their innovative research and connect science to real-world issues. This
experience lays a strong foundation for those pursuing STEM careers and
emphasizes the ethical implications of scientific advancements.</p>
<h4>Hydroponics and Aeroponics Programme</h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Department/SC3.png">
</div>
<p>The hydroponic and aeroponic programme provides students with an engaging
outdoor learning experience that emphasizes values and environmental stewardship.
By exploring soil-less growing methods, they deepen their connection to
nature and learn sustainable practices. Teamwork and collaboration are
key components, as students support one another in nurturing their plants,
fostering respect and friendship. This hands-on experience promotes perseverance
and diligence, illustrating that gardening requires patience and effort.
Additionally, the programme helps students understand how science affects
our world, encouraging them to consider ethical issues related to their
scientific work.</p>
<h4>Earth Day</h4>
<p>Earth Day, celebrated annually in schools, serves as a meaningful platform
to educate students about environmental stewardship and inspire responsibility
towards our planet. Activities such as recycling drives, awareness campaigns,
help students understand sustainability and their impact on the environment.
These efforts align with the Singapore Green Plan’s whole-of-nation approach
to sustainable development and the Ministry of Education’s Eco Stewardship
Programme (ESP), highlighting the vital role of schools in fostering eco-consciousness.
Through these initiatives, students are empowered to adopt lifelong habits
that contribute to a greener, healthier future.</p>
